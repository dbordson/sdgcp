Comments,"Thanks, Jerry. Sale of products for datacom applications increased by $18.2 million or 8.2% compared to the preceding quarter. This is primarily -- is the result of strong demand for our transceivers that address Wireless applications. The sale of products for telecom applications increased by $3.4 million or 4.1% compared to the preceding quarter.


In the fourth -- in the first quarter, we had one 10% or greater customer. Our Top 10 customers represented 57.7% of total revenues, compared to 60.9% in the preceding quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin decreased to 32% from 34.2% in the preceding quarter primarily driven by less favorable product mix, primarily the result of increased sales of transceivers that address Wireless applications and lower sales of 100 gigabit Ethernet transceivers, as well as an increase in depreciation as the result of an increased level of capital expenditures.


Non-GAAP operating expenses increased to $69.4 million from $65.9 million in the preceding quarter. This is primarily the result of the impact of a full quarter of the operating expenses associated with the acquisition of u2t Photonics, which closed during the fiscal fourth quarter; the acquisition of LightSmyth, which occurred during the first fiscal quarter; the costs associated with higher revenue levels during the quarter; the employer portion of payroll taxes associated with annual vesting of RSUs, which occurs every June; and higher legal expenses associated with multiple current ongoing patent litigations.


Non-GAAP operating income decreased $3.5 million to $35.4 million or 10.8% of revenue compared to $38.9 million or 12.7% of revenue in the preceding quarter primarily as the result of lower gross margin and higher operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating -- non-GAAP income was $33.3 million or $0.32 per diluted share compared to $37 million or $0.36 in the preceding quarter. Average diluted shares for non-GAAP purposes totaled approximately 106 million. This includes the impact of converting the $40 million of outstanding principal amount of our 5% coupon convertible notes to equity for purposes of calculating EPS. Therefore, you need to add back approximately $539,000 of interest expense and other costs associated with the 5% convertible notes to calculate diluted EPS.


For non-GAAP purposes, our $258 million of 0.5% convertible notes due in 2033, the interest expense associated with these convertible notes was approximately $323,000 in Q1. This interest expense is the only impact of these converts on our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. For purposes of calculating non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q1, no shares are added as the result of the issuance of these notes. Non-GAAP taxes are expected to be approximately 6% for the remainder of the fiscal year.


Weighted average fully diluted shares for the fiscal second quarter are expected to be approximately 106 million for non-GAAP purposes. First fiscal quarter capital expenditures totaled $44.2 million. Depreciation increased $2.1 million in the fiscal first quarter. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $45 million in the fiscal second quarter primarily driven by the continued construction on the exterior shell of the second building of our new Wuxi, China factory. Second quarter depreciation is expected to increase approximately $2 million.


Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased $15.6 million to $497.4 million at the end of the first quarter compared to $513 million at the end of the preceding quarter. This is principally is the result of capital expenditures of $44.2 million, increase of inventory of $10.4 million, partially due to the acquisition of LightSmyth, increased accounts receivable of $6.3 million due to higher revenue levels and the reduction of accrued compensation of approximately $10 million primarily due to the payment of fiscal year end bonuses. There are a number of noncash or infrequently occurring charges and benefits, which we exclude from non-GAAP results, these totaled $19.1 million last quarter. We included all these items as required under GAAP with generated net income of $14.2 million or $0.14 per diluted share compared to $28.8 million or $0.28 per diluted share in the preceding quarter.


That concludes my comments and I'll turn it over to Eitan.
So Alex, I'll talk a little bit about the margins and I'll hand it over to Jerry for your second question. So as we mentioned, the reason the margins declined in the first quarter were the product mix that you mentioned. We sold a lot more Wireless transceivers, our transceivers for Wireless applications, which as you mentioned have lower gross margin. Combine that with the fact we sold less 100G, which has a higher gross margin and the fact that we added approximately $2 million of depreciation. That drove the decline of gross margin in Q1. To your point in Q2, as we sell less Wireless, and that's part of the reason why revenue was declining, a big contributor in Q2, you're right that the mix gets a little bit more favorable but that is offset by the decline in the overall revenue rate, as well as the fact that as we mentioned, depreciation again is going to increase approximately $2 million and we had our annual salary increases that happened at the beginning of the quarter and so that increases our manufacturing costs. So there is a little bit of a benefit to the mix, but the lower revenues and the higher costs offset that.
Well, I think as you point out, the key things driving it are going to be mix and revenue growth and those are obviously, difficult to predict. But I would say to your point, given the Q3 will have 1 month of the telecom price erosion and Q4 will have 3 months, that I think gross margins are going to stay in the low-30s for the remainder part of the fiscal year.
So for Q1, I'd say, the way to answer that question is we saw a slight decrease in 10G, 40G and the 100G Ethernet. And with the areas we saw growth, wherein as you pointed out, the Wireless as well as in the short wave transceivers or some of the Fibre Channel business.
I can take the consolidation question and we're always looking at opportunities for additional acquisitions and consolidation plays, but we haven't done anything at this point. But we will continue to look at those this fiscal year and beyond. In terms of the capital expenditures, we are spending an inordinate amount of money now on capital expenditures. As we talked about, some of that is being driven by the second building that we're building in Wuxi. But I think, ultimately, I think it's a testament to the fact that we ultimately believe in the long-term growth prospects of this business. But we do hope that once the building is completed, that starting next fiscal year, we'll have a lower level of capital expenditures.
We have in the past and we'll continue in the future on an ongoing basis to analyze the potential cash needs of the business both organically and inorganically and the rate of return for the deploying that capital to increase shareholder value. And we'll compare that to the alternatives to return capital and we'll make decisions accordingly. But we feel, as Jerry mentioned, we feel very good about the business. We feel like there's places where we can invest in R&D, places where we can invest in our manufacturing and infrastructure and potentially acquisitions that we can make that can increase shareholder value. So we're always looking at balancing that with the potential to return cash to shareholders.
We don't really comment on specific customers. So I can't really help you on that question.
Well again, I think in terms of CapEx, we're -- this quarter and the next quarter will probably be at very similar levels and then start to see it tail off a little bit again starting in the following fiscal year. But you have to remember, you have to kind of -- given that most assets are depreciated over 5 years, we're comparing the CapEx we spent this quarter versus the CapEx we spent 5 years ago. And that's the reason for the depreciation. We have a very small amount of depreciation rolling off and we've got a higher amount of depreciation being added on because of these high CapEx levels.
I think that sounds about right, Yes.
I guess, I'll take the first question and say again, our customers don't like us to talk about the different parts of the datacom business and split that out. So we can't provide that level of detail at this point.
Well again, it will depend on overall revenue growth and to your point, the relative revenue growth in Wireless versus other parts of the business. So certainly to the extent Wireless grows faster than that is a negative factor on gross margins. But at the same time, obviously, were doing things that we are trying to offset that. I would say typically gross margins in the third quarter, assuming a reasonable level of growth or relatively flat excluding mix. And so obviously, depending on what you assume on mix then that would determine what you assume on gross margins.
Well again, Bill, our customers have specifically asked us not to go into details in breaking apart those 2 businesses. So we are not going to be doing that.
Well, tunable XFP continues to ramp and our visibility is -- what we have right now is that these trends will continue going forward. As far as the overall telecom quarter-over-quarter, we grew, I think between 3% to 4%. And we say that there's some softness going into the Q2. So we expect it to be slightly soft going in here. But it becomes product-specific and the ROADMs -- there's a lot of developments around the ROADMs, the WSSs and the biggest impact on those is going to be when there's going to be a lot more demand from metro application, which we think that's 2015.
Well I think we said a couple of quarters ago, it was approximately 10% and as we said for this quarter, I think it was one of the primary -- the primary driver for the revenue growth we saw this quarter. But we're not going to break that out as a specific dollar amount.
Well, I think, again, given that we've already got one quarter behind us, giving guidance for sort of the second quarter, I mean, I think ultimately, we give guidance for the year then you're asking us to give guidance for Q3 and Q4. But I think what we've talked about in the past in terms of the overall markets and for the long-term, again, I think industry analysts expect this business to grow in kind of in the mid-teens and I think we have shown that over time, we tend to take market shares. So I still think -- we think of this long-term as a mid-teens growth business. And hopefully, if we grow that way, we'll get some leverage in our business and add faster to the bottom line. But, again, we're not going to provide our full year revenue guidance. We just don't have that level of visibility. We have never done that in the past, and we're not in any position to do it now.
Well, I think Jerry said that 100G was going to be a little soft in this quarter and I think again, it's going to be a -- continue to be a very competitive market. A while ago, as Jerry had mentioned, at one point we we're kind of the only game in town for that market, but other competitors have come in. That's the part of the natural process in this industry. But it's still a good product for us and still a good gross margin product for us. It's just not as good as it's been in the past and the revenue is soft.
Well, again, I think revenue growth -- returned revenue growth and obviously, the 10G and above Ethernet business, I think would -- could be a positive factor for that. But it's hard to predict how that is going to offset against the price erosion and the growth in Wireless. So that's why like I said, I think for the rest of the fiscal year, we're going to be in the low-30s in terms of gross margin.
Well, it depends on the revenue growth, right. I mean, you could have the same mix and if you've got a lot more revenue then we would expect margin to improve. If revenue goes down, we would expect it not to improve. So I think that's one big factor you've got to take into account.
I mean, again, it depends on the Wireless growth relative to the growth of the other products and the magnitude of the Wireless growth and the magnitude of the growth of the other products. So I don't think you can answer that question in a vacuum.
Well, again, I think they do have other customers, but as we mentioned from a revenue perspective, it's not material to our revenues. So I think they'll continue to have other customers. In terms of the vertical integration, Eitan can talk about that.
It's not a high labor-intensive component.","Thanks, Jerry. The sale of products for datacom applications decreased by $25.3 million or 10.5% compared to the preceding quarter. The sale of products for telecom applications decreased by $5.3 million or 6.2% compared to this preceding quarter.


In the second quarter, we had one 10% or greater customer. Our top 10 customers represented 55.8% of total revenues compared to 57.7% in the preceding quarter.


Non-GAAP gross margin decreased to 31.1% from 32% in the preceding quarter, primarily driven by decreased revenue levels and an increase in depreciation. Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased by $2.1 million, primarily due to lower legal costs related to ongoing patent litigation.


During the quarter, the company resolved one of its outstanding patent litigation cases. Non-GAAP operating income decreased $10.4 million to $25 million or 8.4% of revenues compared to $35.4 million or 10.8% of revenues in the preceding quarter, primarily as the result of lower revenue and gross margins.


Non-GAAP income was $23.5 million or $0.23 per diluted share compared to $33.3 million or 32% -- $0.32 in the preceding quarter.


Average diluted shares for non-GAAP purposes totaled 105.3 million. This includes the impact of converting the outstanding principal amount of our 5% convertible notes to equity for the purpose of calculating EPS. Therefore, you need to add back approximately $533,000 of interest expense and other costs associated with the 5% convertible notes to calculate diluted EPS.


Towards the end of the quarter, the company announced its intent to redeem the remaining $40 million of outstanding principal of our 5% converts due 2029. Prior to the schedule of redemption, the holder voluntarily converted such notes into shares of Finisar common stock. The notes were converted in accordance with the existing terms of the notes. $3.4 million were converted for approximately 314,000 shares on the Friday during the last week of the quarter. The remaining 36.7 million were converted during the first week of the third quarter for approximately 3.4 million shares.


For non-GAAP purposes, for our $258 million of 0.5% convertible notes due in 2033, the interest expense associated with these convertible notes was approximately $323,000 in Q2. This interest expense is the only impact of these converts on our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. For purposes of calculating non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q2, no shares are added as the result of the issuance of the 0.5% convertible notes.


Non-GAAP taxes are estimated at 6% for the remainder of fiscal 2015. Weighted average fully diluted shares for fiscal third quarter are expected to be approximately 105.7 million for non-GAAP purposes.


Second quarter capital expenditures totaled $28.4 million. This was less than our prior forecast of approximately $45 million, primarily due to an approximate 1 quarter delay in the completion of the second building of our new Wuxi, China factory as well as the delay of certain planned capital expenditures due to lower-than-expected revenue levels. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $40 million in the third quarter, primarily driven by the continued construction of the second building of our new Wuxi, China factory. We now expect the second building to be completed by March 2015, and we expect to have all volume manufacturing moved from Shanghai to Wuxi and requalified with customers by October 2015.


We continue -- we will continue to perform R&D and NPI manufacturing in Shanghai as well as some corporate functions at that site.


Depreciation increased $1.3 million in the second fiscal quarter. Third quarter depreciation is expected to increase approximately $1.5 million.


Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased $20 million to $477.4 million at the end of the second quarter compared to $497.4 million at the end of the preceding quarter. It's primarily the result of capital expenditures of $28.4 million, increased inventory of $14.7 million, and legal settlement and associated expenses of approximately $13.7 million.


There are a number of noncash or infrequently occurring charges and benefits, which we excluded from non-GAAP results. These totaled $34.8 million last quarter. If you include all these items as required under GAAP, we generated a loss of $11.4 million or $0.11 per diluted share compared to net income of $14.2 million or $0.14 per diluted share in the preceding quarter.


That concludes my comments, and I'll turn it over to Eitan.
Sure. So again, you saw last quarter we did throttle it back some based on revenue expectations for that quarter. But it's really on a product-by-product basis. And there are definitely products where we need to add capacity. And certainly, there's CapEx spent on ramping newer products. So I still think until we finish the second Wuxi building. It's going to be high. And I think that's going to go through, as we talked about -- now it's probably going to go through the end of at least the fourth fiscal quarter and probably a little bit into Q1. But then I think starting in Q2 we could get a more normalized CapEx rate. But as Jerry mentioned, we expect growth in this business and, in particular, in areas like 40 gig, and we're going to continue to add capacity there.
I'll take the gross margin question. So as you think about -- obviously, we don't provide guidance for Q4 gross margin, and it's highly dependent on revenue growth and mix. But as you point out, traditionally, the fourth quarter gross margin is lower than the third quarter gross margin given that there is the full 3 months of the telecom price reductions baked in.
Well, again. We don't provide guidance for Q4. I would say traditionally, Q4 has been relatively flat, again, because you've got all things -- all else being equal, because you've got the full 3 months of the price erosion. But obviously, each Q4 is very different if you look back at history. So again, we're not providing guidance. But in terms of long term, certainly, we think the business is going to continue to grow. It goes back to the prior question about capital expenditures. We wouldn't be spending the money we're spending to make sure we can make the products that our customers demand if we didn't think there was going to be growth. So we're still very confident about long-term growth.
Are you saying if we excluded wireless? I mean, as Jerry mentioned, we expect 40 gig and 100 gig to grow in the quarter. So even without growth in wireless, we would expect the business to grow.
Well, I think it depends on where we are in the range of revenue guidance, right? It's a $15 million range of revenue guidance, so depending on if we're at the high end or the low end. But I think that is going to drive it. But we think there's going to be meaningful growth in 40 gig and also 100 gig in the quarter. It's not just all wireless.
I don't think we can actually predict exactly, if we're at the high end of the range, what products get us there. I mean, it's possible if we're at the high end of the range, that is driven by wireless. But it's also possible if we're at the high end of the range, it's driven by 40 gig. So I think there's a lot of variables, but I think when you take all those variables, product mix, into account, revenue growth and the 1 month of the price erosion, that's how we got our estimate of approximately 31% gross margin.
Well, again, I think as you look at what industry analysts have, I mean, I think for the industry, it's relatively low teens revenue growth, but we traditionally have gained market share. So and our hope is overall revenue to grow in the mid-teens over time. In terms of where we want to get the business, obviously, as we talked about last time, we're kind of at the lows of traditionally where gross margins have averaged. We've been as low as 30 and as high as 37. Our goal is to get them closer to the mid-30s. But we've got but a long ways to go. In terms of OpEx, our goal is to try to drive that closer to being 20% of revenue. But again, we've got a ways to go to that. We're continuing to invest in R&D, as Eitan talked about, but at the same time, we're trying to show some leverage on the operating expense line as we expect to do this quarter.
Yes, Troy. It was at the higher end of the 10% to 15% range again this year.
I don't think there's anything conceptually or philosophically. As Jerry mentioned, we're big believers in consolidation. We think the space needs consolidation. And as you mentioned, there's a lot of activity going on in the space right now, and we will continue to evaluate it. But as always, there's a lot of factors that go into M&A deals and whether or not they get done. And it can be challenging.
No. That detail is in the earning slides, and I mentioned it in the script.
Well, I think inventory going up is not a surprise when revenues were meaningfully -- were lower than expected. So that was not a big surprise. Obviously, we're working hard to reduce our inventory levels and adjust those accordingly based on our current forecasts, so we'll continue to work on that. But that was not a big surprise. In terms of CMI inventory hubs, I don't think we saw anything unusual in the quarter. And again, our forecast typically is based on what our customers are telling us they're going to pull from those hubs in a quarter, which maybe end up being different, but it's our best estimate based on what has been pulled through this quarter so far and what our customers are telling us. So I don't think there was a lot there. In terms of your comment about E&O. Again, that is an accounting exercise, and it is a noncash charge and so it's not a big deal.
No. It's a mathematical exercise, where we basically look at backward looking usage versus the current inventory out there. So I'm not going to get into all the details of what those products would be.
Well again, I think, as we have talked about, I mean, if you assume our revenue was down, then our OEM pulls were down. But as Jerry talked about, some of that was driven by some participants that don't use -- necessarily use hubs. So it's hard to parse that. But I would say that obviously, we expected revenues to be higher, which means probably hub pulls were a little bit less than expected. But our forecast for the third quarter takes into account what we're seeing in terms of current trends of hub pulls.
There was one 10% or greater customer, and top 10 represented 55.8% versus 57.7% in the prior quarter.
Sure. So you're right, I mean, gross, from a product mix perspective, it was relatively favorable given the fact that the wireless stuff carries lower gross margin than our average. But at the same time, you need to remember there was a pretty dramatic drop in volume. And because we're a vertically integrated manufacturer, we've got a fair amount of fixed cost. So I would say it was a favorable mix, but then offset by the drop in volume.
Do you mean quarter-over-quarter?
Yes, so I think for the third quarter for telecom, I would think it's going to be flat to slightly down, given the 1 month of the telecom price erosion. And the growth would primarily, as Jerry mentioned, be from 40 gig Ethernet, 100 gig Ethernet. And the wireless switch we've talked about, we include in our datacom product area.
It's about $28 million. $28.4 million.
Well, we had expected wireless to be significantly down in the second quarter. And I'd say, it was even weaker than we had expected. At the time we gave guidance back in September, our hopes were that we'd start to see pickup again in the wireless in our last month of our quarter. It really didn't happen. But as Jerry mentioned earlier, in our Q3, we expect Wireless to start growing again. And we think that's a growth market overall and for us, but it was just one of those quarters. We had, had a really strong quarter in Q1 and it fell off dramatically in Q2, but we expect it to start to grow again.
It's just test equipment at the end of the day. So we're continuing to add capital equipment. That's driving some of the CapEx that I talked about earlier.","Thanks, Jerry. Datacom revenue increased by $18.5 million or 8.5% compared to the preceding quarter. Telecom revenue decreased by $9.2 million or 11.3% compared to the preceding quarter primarily due to the impact of 1 month of the annual telecom price reduction that typically takes effect on January 1 and a decrease in demand for transceivers for telecom applications driven by sluggish carrier CapEx levels. In the third quarter, we had one 10% or greater customer. Our top 10 customers represented 56.1% of total revenues compared to 55.8% in the preceding quarter. Non-GAAP gross margins decreased to 30% from 31.1% in the preceding quarter, primarily driven by the impact of 1 month of the telecom price reduction and the impact of substantial yield loss for a new optical engine product for supercomputing applications that we started to ramp into production during the quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased $2.2 million to $65.1 million from $67.3 million in the preceding quarter. Non-GAAP operating income increased $1.9 million to $26.9 million or 8.8% of revenues compared to $25 million or 8.4% in the preceding quarter, primarily as the result of higher revenue and lower operating expenses. Non-GAAP income was $26.7 million or $0.25 per diluted share compared to $23.5 million or $0.23 in the preceding quarter. Average diluted shares for non-GAAP purposes totaled $106 million. For non-GAAP purposes, the interest expense for our $258 million of 0.5% convertible notes was approximately $323,000 in the third quarter, this interest expense is the only impact of these converts in our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share as no shares are added to the fully diluted share counts. Third quarter capital expenditures totaled $31.7 million. This was less than our prior forecast of approximately $40 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $35 million in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the continued construction of the second building on our new Wuxi, China factory. We expect the second building to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter and we expect to have all remaining volume manufacturing moved from Shanghai to Wuxi and requalified with customers by the end of our second quarter of fiscal 2016. We will continue to perform R&D and NPI manufacturing work in Shanghai as well as some corporate functions. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased $11.4 million to $488.9 million at the end of the third quarter. Non-GAAP taxes are estimated at 6% for the fourth quarter and 6% to 7% for fiscal 2016. Weighted average fully diluted shares for the fiscal fourth quarter are expected to be approximately 107 million for non-GAAP purposes. There are a number of noncash or infrequently occurring charges in benefits which we exclude from non-GAAP results. These totaled $25 million last quarter. To include all these items, as required under GAAP, we generated net income of $1.7 million or $0.02 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $11.4 million or $0.11 per diluted share in the preceding quarter.


That concludes my comments, and I'll turn it over to Eitan.
Well, again, the guidance is reflective of the fact that -- the revenue guidance is reflective of the fact that we'll have the 1 extra week offset by the impact of Chinese New Year. The gross margin guidance is reflective of the fact that we will have 14 weeks of expenses as well as we'll have the full 3 months of the telecom price reduction.
Well, there's always variability of mix.
No, we typically provide a range about that wide. We widened it up a little bit this quarter just to reflect the fact that we've got 14 weeks instead of 13 weeks.
Well, I'd say the impact this quarter of that yield loss was probably about 75 basis points. In terms of the -- and certainly we're working on improving that yield. But as of today, we haven't made as much progress as we'd like, so I think we will continue to be challenged this quarter. But hopefully, by the time we get into Q1, we'll start to see some of the benefit in terms of the revenue opportunity. I think the revenue opportunity right now is still relatively small versus our overall business. But certainly, it's a business that we hope, once we improve the yield, that will be a proven [ph] ramp and sell a lot more. But it's still a pretty small part of our business even though it's having a big impact on our gross margins.
I mean, the way we're guiding telecom for next quarter, we say it's pretty much flat for this quarter. And maybe with the 14 weeks it's flat to slightly up, but no significant change quarter-over-quarter. There's some new products that are coming to the market right now from us, and as they ramp through the year, we should see an improvement. But most improvement, like we were talking before, what will be the driver for telecom, will be the metro, that still has few quarters to go before it becomes meaningful for the revenue on that segment.
Well, I think there are several factors. Certainly, we are focused on trying to keep OpEx relatively flat given the decline in gross margins so that we can improve our operating margin. So there are certainly a lot of focus on that. We did benefit some this quarter based on the continuing strengthening of the dollar. So I think that's part of it. And we did have some expenses that we thought we'd spend this quarter on R&D Project materials that got pushed into next quarter. So I'd say it's a combination of all 3 of those things.
I think, as Jerry mentioned, I mean, 40 gig and I assume you're talking Ethernet side, datacom side, so 40 and 100, it continues to be a very competitive space. And obviously, we're working hard to maintain our margins despite any pricing pressure that we see.
Well, Subu, we changed our fiscal year 2 years ago in fiscal '13. And so for most fiscal years, we have 13 weeks in every quarter and it's only once every 4 to 5 years that the fourth quarter will have 14 weeks. So we've never had this experience before. But as you think about Q1, given the fact that Q1 will have 13 weeks and Q4 will have 14 weeks, then I would expect revenues would decline just based on the pure number of weeks in the quarter.
Well, again, I think in this quarter you've got the benefit of 14 weeks and some partial offset as the result of Chinese New Year. So you have to take that delta and then apply it and then if there was a 13 to 13-week basis, certainly we would expect some level of growth going from Q4 to Q1. So then you should -- once you've adjusted for 13 versus 14 weeks, you should layer in a little bit of growth.
I would say we obviously don't provide guidance, but typically, the first quarter gross margin is higher than fourth quarter gross margin. So hopefully that pattern continues.
It's hard to break that down because, obviously, if the yield improves then we're also shipping more units, and so some of that offsets each other. But certainly, we've seen in the past -- again, we can look at, historically, meaningful improvement in the first quarter gross margin over the fourth quarter.
I would say operating expenses, most of it is variable. So if you look at that, I would say you're probably going to increase about $3.5 million or so this quarter. And then that $3.5 million would go back down the following quarter, but then there's obviously kind of a normal growth rate of operating expenses. And in the third quarter we just finished, we were at a pretty historically low level given some of the pushout in the project material on the R&D side. So I'd say there will be some growth in fiscal Q1 versus fiscal Q3.
Well, certainly, we've got ways to go given our guidance in Q4 of approximately 30%, but certainly -- we're certainly aiming to get back to the mid-30s, but I think we've got a couple of years to get there. So we should see some improvement from the 30% range in FY '16, we hope. Obviously, it depends on revenue growth and mix, but we've got a couple of years where we need to continue to prove it to get to where we really want it to be.
We're hoping to keep operating expenses relatively flat so that we get some leverage to that extent. And our goal is to ultimately drive that close to 20% of revenue over time. That will obviously depend on -- when we get there, will obviously depend on the pace of revenue growth. But certainly we're looking to get some level of leverage on the operating expense line. Realizing that some quarters are going to be lumpy and some are going to be up and some are going to be down, so it's not going to necessarily a be a straight line. But we certainly are driving towards getting some operating leverage at the operating expense line.
Well, again, we're not provided guidance for that. But historically, Q1 has had better gross margins than Q4.
Well, I'll answer it 2 ways. I think capital expenditures after this quarter should start to decline, as I mentioned the building -- the second building should be done this quarter. And so I would expect capital expenditures to start to decline as a result of that. In terms of depreciation, I expect depreciation to continue to increase because, again, we're comparing current CapEx levels with what's rolling off 5 years -- that you spent 5 years ago. So depreciation will continue to increase, but CapEx should come down and the rate of change of depreciation should start to be less.
Well, again, in this quarter, depreciation went up, I think, about $400,000.
So 40G grew the most, followed by wireless and then 100G.
It's always hard to tell quarter-to-quarter, but I think -- we think that 40G and 100G are going to be growth drivers next quarter. I'd say we expect wireless to be slightly up, but our clarity into that business is not perfect.
Again, we're not going to break it out product by product. I would say, tunable XFP was slightly down in the quarter.
Again, we're not going to break out the details of that. We break out telecom, we break out datacom, and will talk directionally about every product line, but I'm not going to break it out.
Well, we said last December nothing has changed since then. It was at the higher end of the 10% to 15% range.
No, we can't tell.","Well, I think we said both datacom and telecom grew. So I think in general talked about that. I think, again, the strength or the growth in datacom was primarily in 10 Gb and 100 Gb. And we had -- we did have some falloff in our wireless business. On the telecom side, I think we saw a little bit of growth in the WSS as well as I think tunable was a little bit of growth.
I think right now we think wireless in this coming quarter relative to prior quarter will be flat to slightly down given the 13 weeks versus the 14 weeks.
Again, as you think about the fourth quarter, we obviously had the benefit of the 14th week, but that was partially offset by the Chinese New Year. And so if you look at the growth that we had Q3 to Q4, that was about $14 million. So when you're thinking about next quarter, it's hard to exactly say what the impact of both those things were, but I think that's something. You can use that metric.
I don't think there's anything else I can say.
Well, if you're comparing this -- the forecast for this Q1, I believe, to last year's Q1, we did have a big spike in last year's Q1 because of wireless. And as we noted, wireless was -- has been down and we expect it to be probably flat to down a little bit again this quarter based on the 13- to 14-week basis.
Well, you're talking -- Mark, you're talking about the wireless in China, the CPRI wireless. So that's what we said. The majority of the wireless for us is going in China. We expect that for us to be flat to slightly down. So -- and the rest of the year, we'll see how it evolves. We don't know exactly.
Well, again, we continue to invest heavily in R&D. I think new products are the lifeblood of the company, so we'll continue to do that. As I've said several times, I think our ultimate goal is to get OpEx to approximately 20% of revenue. But we've got ways to go there, and that will be driven mainly by increases in revenue and some leverage on the operating expense line. But operating expenses will continue at some pace going forward.
Sure. I think as, again as we said for the guide, what's driving the positive increase is the additional weekly volumes that we expect given that overall revenue is relatively flat. But we have 13 weeks versus 14 weeks. So you got a higher weekly volume, which helps gross margin. As Eitan alluded to, we are seeing increased competition and I think that's the offsetting factor to margins.
Well, we -- I mean, to talk about 100 Gb datacom, again, it's an important part of our business. It grew last quarter. I think we said it's below 10% of revenue, but it's still a meaningful part of our revenue. And I'll let Eitan talk a little bit about CF -- 100 Gb CFP2 coherent.
Well, I think, again, in Q1, we will be losing the benefit of the 14th week, but we do think that most of the growth will come from 40 Gb datacom.
Well, I think, again, I think WSS did grew on the fourth quarter. I think our expectations are it's going to grow again in the first quarter. I don't know if Eitan wants to add some color commentary.
It's hard to exactly say what the impact of the 14-week and Chinese New Year. But I would say in general, if we had -- without the impact of that, I think last quarter would have been relatively flat. So then you can -- but we obviously have already given you our forecast for Q1.
Well, I think Jerry mentioned that we had some lumpiness at one 40 Gb customer that was a little bit lower than expected, so I think that's true. And I also think wireless was probably a little bit lower than expected when we saw, again, a little bit of strength in WSS and tunable despite the fact that we had the full 3 months of the telecom price reduction.
Yes, I mean margin, just forecasting margin beyond 1 quarter is a very difficult thing. There's just too many variables that go into it: revenue growth, product mix, increases in CapEx. So we're not comfortable doing that, so all I can provide you is our guidance for this quarter.
Well, we think it's going to help in that, that we think we're going to have continue to increase volume and we need the space and that's why we're building out the 2 additional floors.
I think all of those factors are very important, and I think they could all have an impact on margins both positively and negatively. And so I don't think we can, again, really forecast beyond the current quarter, but we'll take it 1 quarter at a time.
Yes, those, I think, would be the 2 biggest. I agree with Jerry.
Well, I think the area we're clearly investing the most in relates to 100 Gb CFP2, and I guess Eitan talked about that we expect to see more of those revenues in the next calendar year.
Well, I think -- again, I think some of these expenses are -- will definitely continue. A lot of these expenses, project material expenses that we've talked about related to qualification and new products, that's going to continue for many quarters. Some of that relates very much to the CFP2 that Eitan talked about. But also in the following second quarter, we have our annual merit increases, so I expect that to have a meaningful impact. Typically, merit increases equate to approximately $2 million on the OpEx line, so there will be some increases. But as I mentioned earlier, our ultimate goal is to get some operating leverage and ultimately reduce OpEx to something around 20% of revenue, but that's going to take some time and some revenue growth to get there. So I've talked about in the past, by early part of next fiscal year, hopefully.
Well, what I would say is we talked last time about how it was having about 75 basis points impact on our margin in Q3, and I think we made great strides during this quarter to make up most of that. And I think in general in terms of thinking about gross margin in the future, I wouldn't bake in any additional material improvement on the overall gross margin based on that. Certainly with all our products though, we continue to work on reducing costs and improving yields. But again, this is still, as of now, a relatively small part of our business. But hopefully it will grow over the coming years, but we have made some good progress over the last quarter.
Sure. So let's first talk about the CapEx related to the build -- to our original plan for the second Wuxi building, including fitting out the first 2 floors. Again, that CapEx is just lumpy and a little bit of it got pushed into the first quarter. But that building is done now and those 2 floors are fitted out, and we're in the process of starting to move stuff into those floors. And I think as we've said before, that will take probably several more quarters for that to move that out. And at that time, then our Shanghai facility will be primarily just the R&D and NPI facility. So we expect that to be completed, let's say, in the next 6 months or so once some of the qualifications are done. In terms of fitting out the additional 2 floors, I mean, that's a decision we're making now so that it's finished by the end of next fiscal year, so that we can be ready to hopefully accommodate additional volumes in fiscal '17. So a lot of these decisions to add facility or add capacity, you need to be thinking at least 12 months in advance. And that's what we're doing.
Well, I do think we'll see some benefit once we have completely moved manufacturing out of Shanghai. Which, again, we expect in about 6 months once the qualifications are done, and so we should see some benefit from that. So I think that's important. In terms of any difference between wages in Wuxi and wages in Shanghai, I mean, right now as we sit, we've already filled up our full building in Wuxi. So we've already seen some of that benefit. So that small and incremental amount of stuff that still needs to get moved from Shanghai to Wuxi, will we see a little bit of benefit? Sure. But we've already seen some of that benefit because we've moved a complete building and we've filled up that building with workers that are in Wuxi right now.
Well, I think we said both datacom and telecom grew. So I think in general talked about that. I think, again, the strength or the growth in datacom was primarily in 10 Gb and 100 Gb. And we had -- we did have some falloff in our wireless business. On the telecom side, I think we saw a little bit of growth in the WSS as well as I think tunable was a little bit of growth.
I think right now we think wireless in this coming quarter relative to prior quarter will be flat to slightly down given the 13 weeks versus the 14 weeks.
Again, as you think about the fourth quarter, we obviously had the benefit of the 14th week, but that was partially offset by the Chinese New Year. And so if you look at the growth that we had Q3 to Q4, that was about $14 million. So when you're thinking about next quarter, it's hard to exactly say what the impact of both those things were, but I think that's something. You can use that metric.
I don't think there's anything else I can say.
Well, if you're comparing this -- the forecast for this Q1, I believe, to last year's Q1, we did have a big spike in last year's Q1 because of wireless. And as we noted, wireless was -- has been down and we expect it to be probably flat to down a little bit again this quarter based on the 13- to 14-week basis.

Well, I think, again, in Q1, we will be losing the benefit of the 14th week, but we do think that most of the growth will come from 40 Gb datacom.
Well, I think, again, I think WSS did grew on the fourth quarter. I think our expectations are it's going to grow again in the first quarter. I don't know if Eitan wants to add some color commentary.

Datacom revenue decreased by $8.7 million or 3.6% compared to the preceding quarter, primarily as the result of the impact of 1 fewer week in the prior quarter.


Telecom revenue increased $2.7 million or 3.4% compared to the preceding quarter. In the first quarter, we had two 10% or greater customers. Our top 10 customers represented 60.7% of total revenues compared to 58.8% in the preceding quarter.


Non-GAAP gross margin was 30.2% compared to 30.3% in the preceding quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $68.4 million compared to $68.2 million in the prior quarter and exceeded forecast, primarily due to higher than expected cost associated with the qualification of new products. Non-GAAP operating income decreased $2.3 million to $26.5 million or 8.4% of revenues compared to $28.8 million or 9% of revenues in the preceding quarter, primarily as the result of lower revenue levels. Non-GAAP income was $24.5 million or $0.23 per diluted share compared to $26.9 million or $0.25 in the preceding quarter. Average diluted shares for non-GAAP purposes totaled 108.1 million. For non-GAAP purposes, the interest expense for our $258 million of convertible notes was approximately $323,000 in the first quarter. This interest expense is the only impact of these converts on our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and has no -- and no shares are added to the fully diluted share counts.


Fiscal first quarter capital expenditures totaled $34.7 million, consistent with our forecast of approximately $35 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $35 million in the second fiscal quarter.


Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased $5.5 million to $495.7 million at the end of the first quarter. Non-GAAP taxes for the second fiscal quarter and the remainder of the fiscal year are estimated at approximately 7.5%. Weighted average fully diluted shares for the second fiscal quarter are expected to be approximately 109 million for non-GAAP purposes.


There are a number of noncash or infrequently occurring charges and benefits which we exclude from our non-GAAP results. These total $21.1 million last quarter. If you include all these items as required under GAAP, we generated net income of $3.4 million or $0.03 per diluted share compared to net income of $7.3 million or $0.07 per diluted share in the preceding quarter.


That concludes my comments and I'll turn it back to Jerry.
ROADM was relatively flat last quarter.
Well, I'd say, obviously, we don't provide guidance for this, on the quarter that we're in on margin. And as you point out, there's lots of factors that go in the margin. There's obviously the pace of revenue growth. There's the product mix, including new products especially. And there's the ASP erosion. And so I think those are all factors that are out there. I think as we look at the current fiscal year, as Jerry said, we expect it to be a challenging year. And we obviously haven't gone through the telecom price negotiations yet. That will be kicking in, in January. And typically, if you look at our fiscal year, the progression of margins, Q4 tends to be the lowest margins inside the fiscal year. But there are certainly, as Jerry points out, factors why we're optimistic about FY '17. But sitting here and trying to quantify something that is that far out is very challenging because of all the different factors that play mix, revenue growth and ASP erosion, amongst many others.
I don't know if I -- I think what we've said is, historically, we've kind of been between 30% and 35%. And our goal is to be in that range. Obviously, we're saying, as we talked about starting last quarter, increased competition. And until we get some of these newer products out, that's obviously negatively impacting us. So I think there's -- I think the near term, things are definitely going to be challenging. We've got the price erosion coming up for the telecom side in January. And hopefully, things start to get better in FY '17.
40G is about 1/4 of our datacom business.
I don't think we have any material supply constraints at 40 gig, no.
Well, again, I think every quarter has its unique factors that go into that. But I think, as we -- what we've tried to communicate, obviously we don't give margin guidance beyond that. But the rest of this fiscal year, we expect to be challenged. And again, we do have, in the third quarter, you will have the impact of 1 month of the telecom price erosion. And in the fourth quarter, you'll have the full 3 months. So Q4 typically marks the low water point inside of a fiscal year. And you should model that accordingly.
Yes, there wasn't any kind of one particular product that drove it. I think, in general, we just saw an uptick in several areas. I would say we're not drawing any conclusion off of 1 quarter, and we think that telecom is going to be relatively flat in Q2.
I would say, in terms of what was not as strong as we expected, I think that the two areas would be wireless, which we've talked about as we categorize in the datacom segment. And legacy 100G CFP for datacom was down after an extremely strong quarter in Q4 that we talked about. So I would say, relative to our expectations, I think both those were a little bit lighter than we expected on the datacom side. We expect 100G for data center to bounce back, some in the second quarter and grow. But as Jerry mentioned, we're seeing some lumpiness on -- in the data center and 40G. So after extremely strong 40G quarter in Q1, we expect that to be down some.
Well, obviously, it's product by product. So we have certainly good and not so good products in each category. But I'd say in general, you add it all together, datacom is a little bit better than telecom.
So, all right, let's tackle the first question. I mean, I think as we talked about CapEx, right, so we are finishing the build-out of the second building, the remaining floors, the second building in Wuxi, and that will be completed by the end of this fiscal year. And so obviously, there's an elevated CapEx level associated with that. And we said this quarter it'd be about $35 million and I expect something similar for the subsequent quarters and then dropping back down to a more normalized, call it, $30 million thereafter. In terms of the duplicate facility cost, that just has to do with the move and moving out of -- well, not moving out of, but not fully utilizing the Shanghai building, moving additional operations from Shanghai to Wuxi. So I'd say the progression of that move is happening as planned. By the end of the fiscal year, we should have both those buildings completely built out. And all that we're going to move into those buildings moved, and we'll only be doing NPI and R&D in Shanghai. Your second question, about OpEx. I don't -- we talked about it in the past. Or I don't think anything's really changed. Our goal is to have OpEx approximately 20% of revenue. And I think we're going to get there through containing cost. So I think we're not saying, from the level that we're guiding this quarter that, that OpEx is going to go down. But hopefully, through some level of revenue growth and containing costs outside of incremental sales and marketing costs associated with higher revenues and we should get there, hopefully, in the first half of fiscal '17.
Well, I think Q2 expenses -- operating expenses will be lower than Q1. So we -- they are going down. I think part of that had to do with the fact that Q1 was higher than expected due to some project material related to some of these new projects that Jerry's talking about. So it can be lumpy. But I think a lot of it is spending and that we are investing now for these next generation of products, whether it be on the datacom or telecom side. And so that's why it is at an elevated level. And that's important for us as we go into FY '17 and have the right products. So I think over time, again as a percentage, we're trying to bring that down closer to 20%. But we're obviously going to make the right investment decisions and continue to invest in R&D and technology. So we'll balance our desire to improve our operating leverage with the fact that we need to invest in new products.
So I think we said that we expect both datacom and telecom to be roughly flat this quarter.
Well, I think we said for FY, we've talked about in FY '16, which is the year that we're in, right, that we are seeing increased pricing competition on the datacom side. And we've said that in our call back last June. I think Jerry's comment about why things are going to get better in FY '17 and somebody asked, well, why not sooner, I think one of his answers was for the kind of coherent side, on the metro rollout, that, that was delayed. And so, I still think -- I think those are 2 discrete items. One is FY '16 and one is an FY '17 comment.
And in terms of percent of revenue for 100G, we're looking at -- for 100 -- for CFP, CFP2, we're looking at roughly about 10% of revenue.
That's 10% of overall revenue, just to be clear.
But in terms of production, large production volumes where -- that's why we're pointing towards FY '17. So it will build towards the end of this fiscal year. But we should see the real benefit in FY -- so the material benefit in FY '17.
Well, I think, again, I think, Jerry mentioned, we think it's going to be challenging. But I'd say we expect revenue growth to continue. But at a more muted pace in the near term. But I think in the next fiscal year, we expect that to accelerate.","Thanks, Jerry. Datacom revenue increased by $0.5 million or 0.2% compared to the preceding quarter, primarily driven by growth in 100-gigabit Ethernet transceivers, partially offset by a decrease in 40-gigabit Ethernet transceivers after a record quarter for 40-gig in the preceding quarter. Telecom revenue increased by $6.6 million or 8.2% compared to the preceding quarter, primarily driven by growth in 10-gigabit tunable transceivers and wavelength selective switches.


In the second quarter, we had 2 10%-or-greater customers. Our top 10 customers represented 58.2% of total revenues compared to 60.7% in the preceding quarter.


Non-GAAP gross margin was 30.0% compared to 30.2% in the preceding quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $68 million or 21.2% of revenue compared to $68.4 million or 21.8% of revenue in the preceding quarter.


Non-GAAP operating income increased $1.8 million to $28.3 million or 8.8% of revenue compared to $26.5 million or 8.4% in the preceding quarter, primarily as a result of higher revenue levels.


Non-GAAP income was $26.9 million or $0.25 per diluted share compared to $24.5 million or $0.23 in the preceding quarter. Average diluted shares for non-GAAP purposes totaled 107.5 million.


For non-GAAP purposes, interest expense for our $258 million of 0.5% convertible notes was approximately $323,000 in the second quarter. This interest is the only impact of these converts on non-GAAP diluted earnings per share as no shares are added to the fully diluted share count.


Second quarter capital expenditures totaled $29.5 million, lower than our forecast of approximately $35 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $35 million in the third quarter.


Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased $25.1 million to $520.8 million at the end of the quarter.


Non-GAAP taxes for the third and fourth quarter are estimated at approximately 7.5%. Weighted average fully diluted shares for the third fiscal quarter are expected to be approximately 108.5 million for non-GAAP purposes. There are a number of noncash or infrequently occurring charges and benefits which we exclude from our non-GAAP results. These totaled $20.2 million last quarter. If you include all these items as required under GAAP, we generated net income of $6.6 million or $0.06 per diluted share compared to net income of $3.4 million or $0.03 per diluted share in the preceding quarter.


That concludes my comments, and I'll turn it back to Jerry.
Well, I think in absence of any sort of shift mix, I would say, we typically see the fourth quarter a little bit lower than the third quarter, exactly as you said, because of the 3 full months of the annual telecom price reductions. Ultimately, what will drive that probably most importantly will be mix. And depending on which products -- or how fast we're growing and which products are growing, we'll be plus or minus in that range. But I'd say in general, there will be the impact of the 3 full months, and you should take that into account.
We don't really comment on who those customers are.
Well, I think what I would say is, as we talked about in the quarter, 100-gig grew in the quarter and had a nice strong quarter there. So I think the percentage of overall or datacom revenue that's 100-gig, it went up in the quarter. In terms of 40-gig, as we talked about, 40-gig was down in the quarter after a large uptick in the prior quarter. So I would say directionally, 100-gig as a percent of revenue or datacom went up and 40-gig datacom went down. 10-gig is still the biggest part followed by 40-gig and then 100-gig, but 100-gig is gaining some ground here.
Yes. So CFP2 ACO is very important to us. I think we're making some good progress there. We're in qual with multiple customers and have gotten a lot of positive feedback there. So we think we're moving along nicely. Obviously, we're going to have to add and ramp capacity over time. And as we said before, we expect to have meaningful revenue from that product in the summer of calendar 2016.
So the reason why the CapEx was a little bit lower than expected this quarter just had to do with the timing of expenditures related to the final build-out of the second building in our Wuxi facility. And so it was just a matter of a timing exercise there. I think we've been consistent in saying in fiscal '16, we've been kind of expecting roughly $35 million a quarter in capital expenditures, driven by -- the higher level driven by the Wuxi build-out. And that we expect that to be finished in fiscal '16. And I'd expect capital expenditures as a percentage to drop down some in fiscal '17 to be more in the kind of the $30 million a quarter ballpark. But obviously, that will be driven and modulated based on demand.","Thanks, Jerry. Revenues decreased to $309.2 million, a decrease of $11.9 million or 3.7% from $321.1 million in the preceding quarter.


Telecom revenue increased by $2.6 million or 2.9% compared to the preceding quarter, primarily driven by growth in wavelength selective switches.


Datacom revenue decreased by $14.5 million or 6.2% compared to the preceding quarter, primarily driven by decline in the sale of 40-gigabit transceivers. We attributed this decline primarily to reduced levels of capital spending by Web 2.0 in hyperscale data center customers in anticipation of the rollout of the next generation 100-gig QSFP28 transceivers.


In the third quarter, we had 2 10% or greater customers. Our top 10 customers represented 58.4% of total revenues compared to 58.2% in the preceding quarter.


Non-GAAP gross margin was 30.3% compared to 30% in the preceding quarter as favorable product mix more than offset the impact of 1 month of annual telecom price negotiations, which typically take effect on January 1.


Non-GAAP operating expenses were $67.3 million compared to $68 million in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP income was $26.6 million or $0.25 per diluted share compared to $26.9 million or $0.25 diluted share in the preceding quarter.  Average diluted shares for non-GAAP purposes totaled $108.1 million.


For non-GAAP purposes, interest expense for our $258 million of 0.5% convertible notes was approximately $323,000 in the third quarter. This interest expense is the only impact of these converts on non-GAAP diluted earnings per share as no shares are added to the fully diluted share count.


Third quarter capital expenditures totaled $26.8 million, lower than our forecast of approximately $35 million, as some final expenditures associated with the fit-out of the second building in Wuxi, China rolled into the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $33 million in the fourth quarter.


Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased $10.3 million to $531 million at the end of the quarter.


Non-GAAP taxes for the third quarter were approximately $1 million and are estimated for the fourth fiscal quarter to be approximately $1 million. Non-GAAP taxes for fiscal 2017 are estimated to be approximately 7%.


Weighted average fully diluted shares for the fiscal fourth quarter are expected to be approximately 109 million for non-GAAP purposes. Excluded from our non-GAAP results, a number of charges or benefits that were either noncash or we consider outside of our core ongoing operating results. These totaled $14.5 million last quarter. If you include all these items as required under GAAP, we generated net income of $12.1 million or $0.11 per diluted share, compared to net income of $6.6 million or $0.06 per diluted share in the preceding quarter.


That concludes my comments, and I'll turn it back to Jerry.
Well, again, we only provide 1 quarter of gross margin forecast. As we talked in the past, our hope is always that new products carry higher ASPs and better gross margins. But that obviously depends on our ability to ramp and to yield them efficiently. But certainly, we hope that these products are positive on the gross margin perspective.
The growth quarter-over-quarter in that area was about 25%.
I'm sorry, so you want to compare CFP, CFP2 plus QSFP28 to 40-gig?
Again, I think, I guess the way I'd answer the question is that CFP versus CFP2/CFP4 are approximately the same size at this time. And we expect this QSFP28 ramp so obviously that's going to start shifting things even more in that direction.
Well, right now, our 100 gig, CFP, CFP2, CFP4 and QSFP28 is still a little bit below 40-gig, but not much.
Yes. It was primarily 40-gig but also 10-gig declined a little bit.
Well, again, I think the building is slightly different than the CapEx associated with tested -- the final tested assembly equipment for the constraints that Jerry's talking about. So those are 2 separate items. And again, we expect the CapEx associated with the final buildout in the last couple of floors in Wuxi to be finished in Q4. So what we're forecasting for Q4 is about $33 million of CapEx. And as I've said in the past, I hope that, that declines in FY '17 to something more around $30 million per quarter.
It's just timing. Often with construction projects, the timing of CapEx can be lumpy. And it just so happens that some of the expenditures that we thought would happen in Q3 are actually going to happen in Q4 for where they're building.
Well, again, I think, when you're looking at capacity, there's obviously -- the test and assembly equipment tends to be relatively short-term when you're relieving capacity constraints. Depending on the equipment, it can take anywhere from 3 to 6 months to get that equipment in. And in terms of longer-term capacity, that has more to do with capacity in fabs or big facility buildouts, which is what the Wuxi CapEx is related to.
Well, I think in terms of, as Jerry mentioned, in terms of revenue growth, I mean, our hope is the biggest driver for revenue growth in the coming -- in the calendar year that we're in or fiscal '17 is QSFP28. And we're counting on that to grow meaningfully over the coming quarters, and that should drive overall revenue growth for the company.
Are you talking in terms of the OEMs that are located in China or deployments in China?
Well, again, I don't think we provide guidance again beyond one quarter. But I certainly -- we certainly believe that WSS is a higher than our average gross margin, and so to the extent we sell more and that becomes a higher percentage of our telecom revenue, then that certainly should help. And I think the same thing on the datacom side for the 100-gigabit products. So I think those, the mix could be helpful there. And that will help offset other factors that are obviously always existing in the market.
We expect both to grow sequentially.
Was your second question about year-over-year datacom overall growth?
Sure. So I think first of all, when you're comparing FY '16 to FY '15, I'd say first you got to adjust for the fact that FY '15 had 1 extra week, so that's one of the things. But I think in general, we've been saying for a while that FY '16 was going to be a challenging year top line basis, and it's been a relatively flat year, but that we do feel better about FY '17. And that will be driven by the growth of new products like QSFP28 and CFP2 coherent as well as wavelength selective switches. So I think Jerry has said that we are optimistic for growth in FY '17.
I think it was about $22 million or $23 million. I don't have it right in front of me. It'll be in the 10-Q we just filed.
I would think that 10G will be flat to down and 40G will be relatively flat with the growth coming from 100G.
Well, there's always -- every quarter, there's always an amount of revenue that we leave on the table for certain products. But it's not a number we quantify.
Again, I don't have that number in front of me. That's not a number that we typically break out.
I think it was just some of the legacy products. I think, tunable was relatively flat. I think it was some of the older legacy products. I think amplifiers was a little bit down and some other stuff, but nothing really of note.
Yes. I think we said in the past Web 2.0 is probably about 20% or plus of datacom.
Is it a percent of overall? Or is it a percent of telecom? I mean datacom, sorry.
Yes, as a percent of datacom it's approximately 10%.
Well, we expected it to -- again, as Jerry talked about, we're being very opportunistic in that space, employing in the space when we think it's accretive to EPS. We had expected it to decline last quarter some, it actually was flat. And I'd say right now, as we sit here today, we're expecting approximately flat next quarter as well. But again, it's such an opportunistic situation. It can vary off of that.","Thanks, Jerry. Sales of products for datacom applications increased by $23.6 million or 10.8% compared to the preceding quarter, primarily driven by growth in 40G and 100G transceivers, including CFP, CFP2, CFP4, QSFP and QSFP28 form factors.


Sales of products for telecom applications decreased by $14.1 million or 15.6% compared to the preceding quarter, primarily as the result of the full 3 months of the telecom price negotiations and an unexpected decline in demand for legacy products, including 10G fixed wavelength and tunable transceivers and optical amplifiers. In addition, we experienced delays in adding capacity for manufacturing wavelength selective switches and delays in the qualification of new growth in line cards.


In the fourth quarter, we had 1 10% or greater customer. Our top 10 customers represented 56.4% of total revenues compared to 58.4% in the preceding quarter.


Non-GAAP gross margin improved to 30.6% compared to 30.3% in the preceding quarter, primarily due to favorable product mix partially offset by the impact of the full 3 months of annual telecom price negotiations, which typically take effect on January 1. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $66.2 million, compared to $67.3 million in the prior quarter. The decrease is primarily due to lower G&A costs, including lower legal expenses. Non-GAAP operating income was $31.2 million or 9.8% of revenues compared to $26.3 million or 8.5% of revenue in the preceding quarter. Non-GAAP income was $31.8 million or $0.29 per diluted share compared to $26.6 million or $0.25 per diluted share in the preceding quarter. Average diluted shares for non-GAAP purposes totaled 109.4 million. For non-GAAP purposes, interest expenses for the -- are $258 million of 0.5% convertible notes was approximately $323,000. This interest expense is the only impact of these converts on the non-GAAP diluted earnings per share as no shares are added to the fully diluted share count.


Interest and other income was approximately $685,000 in the fiscal fourth quarter and is expected to be at approximately similar level in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP taxes for the fourth quarter were approximately $100,000. Non-GAAP taxes for fiscal 2017 are expected to be approximately 5% to 6%.


Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased $31.4 million to $562.5 million at the end of the quarter. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $30 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Weighted average fully diluted shares for the first quarter of fiscal '17 are expected to be approximately 111 million for non-GAAP purposes.


We excluded from our non-GAAP results a number of charges or benefits to either noncash or we consider outside of our core ongoing operating operations. This totaled $18.8 million last quarter. If you include all of these items, as required under GAAP, we generated net income of $13.1 million or $0.12 per diluted share compared to net income of $12.1 million or $0.11 per diluted share in the preceding quarter.


That concludes my comments, and I'll turn it back to Jerry.
I would also add that Q3 was a little quarter for us in the 40G. So it's a little bit of a bounce back from a tough Q3 for 40G and, of course, 40G datacom in the fourth quarter. And we think in general, it will be relatively flattish in the Q1.
Yes. Well, we had some pretty extreme, favorable mix this last quarter, obviously, as we talked about with all the growth especially coming -- a lot of the growth coming from 100G datacom and with some of the weakness coming from legacy telecom products that have lower gross margin. And so you saw the benefits in that quarter of what can happen. Obviously, we think we're going to sell more 100G this quarter, which should be helpful, which is why we're comfortable expecting 31% gross margin in Q1. It's hard to predict what the margins will be after that. As always, there's a bunch of factors that determine margin. It's not just product mix. It's revenue growth rate. It's our ability to ramp in yield cost effectively our new products. And obviously, it's the pricing environment. So I'd say we're pleased with where our gross margins were for the fourth quarter. We're happy that the first quarter, as expected, that those gross margins are going to increase, and we'll see where we go after that. But we don't give any guidance beyond Q1.
Well, I would say, in general, that it grew at least...
20% quarter-over-quarter, yes, sort of what I was going to say, about 20% quarter-over-quarter.
Well, so I think first of all, we're not going to break out every single product line. But overall, again, you have the full 3 months of the telecom price reductions that affect every area. WSS was still up a little bit, but it was not up nearly as much as we expected due to the delays of adding capacity that Jerry talked about, not from -- certainly not from a lack of orders. And I would say unexpectedly, we saw 10G tunable declined. Part of that was due to the fact that a large customer ended up pulling several million dollars of product after the end of the quarter that we expected them to pull in the last week of the quarter. And we expect that telecom business to pop back this quarter. So as I think about the growth that we are expecting this quarter at the midpoint, I'd say we probably may see more telecom growth and even datacom growth just given how weak some of the products were in the fourth quarter.
Yes. And part of that was due to the just annual price reductions, and part of that was units.
Again, I'm not going to break it down by product line by product line. But as I said, WSS was up a little bit, and you can do the math on the rest of it.
Are you talking telecom, Alex?
Well, there will be datacom price declines there. As you know, datacom price declines happen every 3 to 6 months. So there will be the typical price declines on the datacom side. But we've gone through the annual telecom price negotiations, and the major impact of that was reflected in Q4.
I think we've talked about it being roughly 20% of datacom, and I still think that number is plus or minus in that ballpark.
Well, as you know, most of our revenue comes through, just in time, CMI inventory hubs. So our book-to-bill is not really a great measure for us, but certainly, it was better than 1. And that is why we're forecasting the growth that we are forecasting.
In Q3, yes. In Q3, we had 2. In Q4, we had 1.
Sure. So of the estimated $30 million expected, there's only a handful of that, that is for facilities. For the most part, we're -- at this point, we're done with the second Wuxi building. I think there might be $1 million left that's going to happen this quarter that's related to that. So most of that is equipment, but obviously, there are some maintenance CapEx as well as some adding capacity. So as far as beyond Q1, I would estimate -- it's always hard to tell, but I would estimate an average of $30 million per quarter for each of the 4 quarters of fiscal '17 at this point.
Yes. There's a lot of factors, as we've talked about in the past, that go into gross margin and trying to predict that 2 years out is the challenge.
WSS.
Yes.
The primary driver of the growth of that business is for WSS on a stand-alone basis.
Yes. So I think we talked last quarter that QSFP28 was about $2.5 million. It more than doubled this quarter, and we'd expect it to more than double again next quarter. In terms of overall 100 gigabit datacom, it's about 25% now of datacom revenue, and that includes CFP, CFP2, CFP4 as well as QSFP28. So that's our  -- and then next is 40G datacom, which is about 22% of datacom. And 10G is also a little bit less now than 40G last quarter but both 21% of datacom.
I think CFP is still bigger than CFP2.
Well, again, I think the decline in the quarter, obviously, was partially due to the price decline, the annual price reductions, but it caught us a little bit by surprise on some of this legacy stuff that's going down -- that went down, I should say. But we expect that business to pop back. And as I said, looking kind at the midpoint of guidance, the $15 million or so of growth, I'd expect more than half of that to come from telecom. So I think that the -- this -- the large decline we saw this quarter, we do not think that that's an ongoing trend. I think in terms of telecom growing and getting back to higher levels, I think that's going to be dependent on 2 things. It's going to be dependent on WSS and ROADM line card growth, which Jerry just talked about. And then it's going to be also dependent on the success of 100G CFP2 ACO. And I think the combination of those 2 things are probably the biggest potential growth drivers to get that business back to a more attractive level.
On the 10G tunable side?
Well, there was one large customer, again, that I mentioned that we thought was going to pull multiple millions of dollars before the end of the quarter and ended up pulling in the first week. So that was specific to that customer. But I don't think -- it was more of a customer thing than a geography thing, I guess.
You know I'm not going to get into that.
Yes. I would say 40G datacom ended up being stronger than expected in the fourth quarter. I also think we were able to make more 100G CFP and CFP2 than expected in the quarter. And so we're able to expand capacity a little bit more there, and we knew that demand was there. So I would say it was a combination of stronger demand in 40G datacom and our ability to make a couple more CFP and CFP2 100G datacom modules than we had originally expected.
Well, again, we've talked about how it was at the high end of the 10% to 15% range. But we've been -- we said that in the last -- in the December conference call. So it wasn't -- didn't end up being worse in this quarter than what we had said back then.
Well, about 20% is fiber channel and then the rest is everything else.
Fiscal fourth quarter was about $20 million, and that was less than expected. So we had some delays in both some of the final CapEx associated with our Wuxi building as well as some delays in some of that CapEx associated with the expansion of capacity for wavelength selective switches. And so it's a little bit lower than expected, but we think for this quarter, they'll be about $30 million.
For telecom, I think 100G is still a pretty small piece of that. As Jerry mentioned, for CFP2 ACO, we're only shipping a small amount of units, so between that and -- 100G is a small amount for us.
It's a -- I wouldn't classify it as any gig. That's a different category or product.","Thanks, Jerry.


Sales of telecom products increased by $22 million or 29% compared to the preceding quarter. This increase was due to higher sales of wavelength selective switches, coherent receivers and 100-gig transceivers as well as a rebound in the demand for other telecom products including amplifiers and 10-gig transceivers, both tunable and fixed wavelength.


Sale of datacom products increased by $0.5 million or 0.2% compared to the preceding quarter, primarily driven by growth in demand for 100-gigabit transceivers including CFP, CFP2, CFP4, and QSFP28 form factors, partially offset by a decline on the sale of transceivers for wireless applications and 40-gig transceivers.


Datacom revenue, excluding transceivers for wireless applications, increased 3.1% over the prior quarter. Sale of 100-gig transceivers for datacom applications increased 21.8% over the prior quarter and 115.8% over the first quarter of the prior fiscal year.


In the first quarter, we had 2 10% or greater customers. Our top 10 customers represented 60.2% of total revenues compared to 56.4% in the preceding quarter. Non-GAAP gross margins improved to 31.1% compared to 30.6% in the preceding quarter, primarily due to favorable product mix and a benefit of vertical integration over the larger volume.


Non-GAAP operating expenses were $69.3 million compared to $66.2 million in the prior quarter. This increase was due to higher payroll taxes from the annual vesting of employee stock grants, higher legal expenses from 2 patent trials that completed in the quarter and higher employee compensation levels. Non-GAAP operating expenses as a percent of revenue decreased to approximately 20.3% of revenue compared to 20.8% in the preceding quarter.


Non-GAAP operating income was $43.5 million or 12.8% of revenue compared to $31.2 million or 9.8% of revenue in the preceding quarter. Non-GAAP income was $41.8 million or $0.38 per diluted share compared to $31.8 million or $0.29 in the preceding quarter.


Average diluted shares for non-GAAP purposes total 110.8 million. For non-GAAP purposes, interest expenses for our $258 million 0.5% convertible notes was approximately $323,000 in the fourth quarter. This interest expense is the only impact of these converts on non-GAAP earnings per diluted share as no shares are added to the fully diluted share count.


Interest and other income was approximately $300,000 in the first fiscal quarter and is expected to be at a similar level on the second fiscal quarter.


Non-GAAP taxes for the first quarter were approximately $2 million, and non-GAAP taxes for the second fiscal quarter and the remainder of the year are estimated between 4% and 5%.


Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments increased $31.3 million to $593.8 million at the end of the quarter. Capital expenditures are expected to be about $30 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Weighted average fully diluted shares for the second fiscal quarter are expected to be approximately 112 million for non-GAAP purposes.


We have excluded from our non-GAAP results a number of charges or benefits that would -- either noncash or we consider outside of our core ongoing operating results. These totaled $17.9 million last quarter. If you exclude all these items as required under GAAP, we generated net income of $23.9 million or $0.22 per diluted share compared to net income of $13.1 million or $0.12 per diluted share in the preceding quarter.


That concludes my comments, and I'll turn it back to Jerry.
Well, I think the -- there are 2 things that drove the better-than-expected gross margins in the quarter. I think was -- first was favorable product mix. I think not only did we sell more 100-gig transceivers than we expected, but we had a meaningful decline in wireless transceivers, which as we've talked about in the past have a less-than-average gross margin. So there definitely was a favorable mix component to that. And then I think the other thing was we had higher volumes than expected. And as Jerry pointed out, when we have higher volumes, we benefit from our vertical integration strategy that differentiates us from others. So I think it was the combination of the 2 that helped us get to the 33%. Obviously, we're hoping that, that continues to improve, and we are guiding to 34% for our next quarter. So we are hopeful that's a positive trend that will continue. But as always, we only give one quarter guidance.
Well, I think what we said last time was that we expected QSFP28 to more than double this quarter, and it definitely did that. And again, we expect that to be the major -- one of the major growth drivers for the subsequent quarter. And that's quite possible that that's going to double again or more in the quarter -- in Q2. So I think that's a big growth engine for us, and we are capacity constrained, as Jerry mentioned, and we're adding capacity as fast as we can on those products.
Well, I think it's still relatively small for us, and so I wouldn't say it materially contributes to that growth. We expect it to grow, but it's not material as a percent of our overall telecom business at this point. But it's an important product for us, and we continue to work hard to get that product qualified at various customers and to ramp our production capacity.
I think, again, WSS was strong. We had said we expected it to grow 10%, and it grew meaningfully better than that. So that was, obviously, a key contributor to the growth in telecom. But we really saw a rebound, a broad rebound in our telecom products. As we talked about last quarter, we saw kind of an unexpected decline in a variety of products last quarter. But we expected those to rebound, and we factored that into our guidance. And so it was a pretty broad rebound in telecom. WSS was certainly a key contributor. In terms of our forecast and factoring in some qualification on line cards, certainly, we have some revenue baked into that for the qualification. But again, we don't expect that to have a huge impact until the subsequent quarter, hopefully, since we'll only -- if we get qualified this quarter, will only have a partial impact.
Sure. So 40 gig was down a little bit this quarter, but I think the context you have to understand is last quarter was surprisingly strong in that business. We actually went back and saw that, that was our second highest quarter in terms of 40-gig revenue on the datacom side. It was last quarter. And we all know that business tends to be quite lumpy. So even though 40 gig was down a little bit this quarter relative to incredibly strong Q4, it was still up relative to Q3. In terms of the future for 40 gig or our forecast for Q2, we're still very positive on 40 gig. We think it's going to be -- could grow. It'll be flat, but hopefully grow. And 10 gig grew a little bit last quarter, and I think probably will be more flattish this quarter. But both those products are still very important products in our product portfolio, and the revenues are holding up quite well.
Well, again, I think you need to understand it's a big part of telecom, but it was not -- so it did not grow as fast as the 30% that we had -- roughly 30% that we had for telecom. But from a dollar perspective, it was a very large contributor, if that makes sense.
Well, again, I think we've talked for a long time about, historically, our margins have been between 30% and 35%. And when we're going through these cycles, where we have new products out there with better gross margins and our revenue is growing at a strong pace, then we tend to be towards the upper end of that range. And that's what we're seeing now. I think last year when we didn't have the newer products, we were at the lower end of the range. So I think we're very pleased with what margins we had last quarter. I'd say we're very pleased with what we see is the outlook. And depending on how fast we continue to grow revenue and what the mix of that revenue is, we're hopeful that those margins can further improve.
Yes. 40G is about 20% of datacom at this point.
So I think your assumptions historically have been correct in the fact that I think a couple of years ago, certainly that was the case where I think the datacom margins were running higher than telecom. But I think we've been saying it for a while now that I think they're kind of within spitting distance of each other at this point. Obviously, it's highly dependent on the products that we're talking about in both datacom and telecom. I have products that have margins meaningfully higher than our current margins and meaningfully lower. So it's really a product-by-product basis. But right now, I would say they are roughly equivalent.
I think in general, I'd say some up, some down. As we've talked about in the past, this is pretty lumpy. So we talked a little bit about 40 gig being down a little bit, and that's primarily the Web 2.0. But I'd still say they've been at approximately the same level. But as Jerry pointed out, we sold a lot more QSFP28 where some of that is going to the Web 2.0. So I'd say in general, it's been approximately the same percentage for us, but we certainly are optimistic on that business and expect it to grow meaningfully.
That's always a tough question. I think on a percentage basis, I think they could each grow at the roughly the same percentage. But I think since datacom is roughly 70% of the business from a nominal dollar perspective, my guess is datacom will grow more, if that makes sense.
It's always hard to break that out. But I'd say approximately of 1 point of that was related -- a point, and maybe a little bit more than a point was related to mix, and a little less than a point was related to leverage in the facility. But those are hard, hard calculations to isolate.
Yes. I mean, I think again when we talked about last quarter that fact that again telecom was surprisingly down meaningfully last quarter. And we talked about some of that just being timing issues and timing of polls and stuff like that. So again, just like I told you not to read too much about the decline last time, I wouldn't necessarily extract extrapolate off of the 30% growth this quarter. But like I said, we expect our overall business to grow meaningfully this quarter, and we expect telecom to grow meaningfully and contribute to that this quarter.
Sure. So we had expected the CapEx to be close to $30 million this quarter, but it was less. So to be clear, it was closer to $20 million. That was primarily 2 things. We had some expenditures associated with some fit out of an additional space in our Ipoh, Malaysia facility, and that rolled from Q1 to Q2. And then also, we had some timing of receiving some high dollar amount equipment into one of our fabs that also got pushed. So neither of those had impact on our capacity but did push -- made our CapEx this quarter to be closer to $20 million than $30 million. For this quarter, we expect $30 million, approximately $30 million of CapEx. And I'd say for the remaining part of the fiscal year, we'd expect about $30 million of CapEx per quarter.
Yes.
I'm not sure of the exact question you're asking. I mean, they're -- our top customers are the same top customers that we've had in the past. What's the second part of your question?
Yes. That's not a -- those aren't numbers that we break out. But needless to say, both those customers have been strong.
The non-GAAP tax rate, yes, 4% to 5% for the rest of the year, yes.
Yes. Well, I think when you look at last quarter, datacom, we had expected datacom to grow overall at a higher rate, and I'd say the main thing that was significantly softer than expected was the wireless business. And as we talked about in the past, that business has again lower gross -- significantly lower gross margins than the other parts of our business, and that's what helped us with our margins. So that -- I think that's part of it. Again, I think we thought 40 gig would be more flat. It was down a little bit. So -- but again, that was coming off of a quarter where it was our second highest quarter in 40 gig ever. So again, that business tends to be lumpy because it tends to go into the Web 2.0 guys. So I'd say 40 gig was a little lighter than expected. Wireless was significantly lighter than expected. As we go to the telecom side, I think again we had predicted a rebound after last quarter when we gave our guidance. I would just say some of these things just bounce back a little bit better than expected. And so it was -- again, the telecom growth was really a pretty broad-based rebound in growth.
I mean, clearly, we expect the growth in the quarter on the datacom side to be both on the CFP, CFP2 as well as QSFP28. I think as I mentioned, we expect QSFP28 will -- could double again or more than double again this quarter. So both those products, we expect to see growth and strengthen. I think 10 gig and 40 gig will be more likely more flattish. But again, those can vary quarter-to-quarter by a couple of million dollars. But again, we think those businesses have legs, and we're not reading into any one quarter down or any one quarter up in either of the 10 or the 40-gig datacom business, so...
It was actually up a little bit.","Thank you, Jerry. Sales of telecom products increased by $9.7 million or 9.9% compared to the first quarter. This increase was due to higher sales of 100-gigabit transceivers as well as wavelength selective switches and ROADM line cards. Sales of datacom products increased by $18.8 million or 7.7% compared to the first quarter. This increase was primarily due to higher sales of 100-gig transceivers. Sales of 100-gig transceivers for datacom applications increased approximately 30% compared to the first quarter and more than 80% over the second quarter of the prior fiscal year. Sales of 40-gig transceivers were approximately flat compared to the first quarter.


In the second quarter, we had two 10% or greater customers. Our top 10 customers represented 57.9% of total revenues compared to 60.2% in the first quarter. Non-GAAP gross margins improved to 37.2% compared to 33.1% in the first quarter, primarily due to favorable product mix and operational leverage from our vertical integration.


Non-GAAP operating expenses were $69.4 million compared to $69.3 million in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses as a percent of revenue decreased to approximately 18.8% of revenue compared to 20.3% in the first quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $68.3 million or 18.5% of revenue compared to $43.5 million or 12.8% of revenue in the first quarter. Non-GAAP income was $65.2 million or $0.58 per diluted share compared to $41.8 million or $0.38 in the preceding quarter. Average diluted shares for non-GAAP purposes totaled 113.2 million.


For non-GAAP purposes, interest expense for our $258 million of 0.5% convertible notes was approximately $323,000 in the second quarter. This interest expense is the only impact of this converts on non-GAAP diluted earnings per share as no shares are added to the fully diluted share count.


Interest and other income was approximately $500,000 in the second quarter and is expected to be a similar level in the third quarter. Non-GAAP taxes for the second quarter was approximately $3.6 million, non-GAAP taxes for the third quarter and the remainder of the fiscal year are estimated to be approximately 5%. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments increased $32.5 million to $626.3 million at the end of the quarter.


Capital expenditures for the upcoming third quarter are estimated to be approximately $40 million. This elevated level of CapEx will continue in the fiscal fourth quarter as well. Weighted average fully diluted shares for the third fiscal quarter are expected to be approximately 115 million for non-GAAP purposes.


We've excluded from our non-GAAP results a number of charges or benefits that were either noncash or we consider outside our core ongoing operating results. These totaled $16.4 million in the last quarter. If you excluded all of these items, as required under GAAP, we generated net income of $48.8 million or $0.43 per diluted share compared to net income of $23.9 million or $0.22 per diluted share in the first quarter.


That concludes my comments, and I'll turn it back to Jerry.
Well, there's always a lot of factors that go into margin as we know. It comes down to revenue growth, product mix and the competitive environment. I think, as Jerry pointed out, the telecom price reductions were less this year than we've seen in prior years. So obviously, that's helpful as you think about having the full 3 months of impact in the fourth quarter, so that's helpful. But again, we're not going to provide guidance for the fourth quarter.
Yes, I can answer that. I think between WSS and ROADM line card, there's about 10% growth last quarter in terms of -- I'm sorry, you wanted to break down what of datacom?
Yes. 10-gig was actually up a little bit, wireless was actually down several million dollars. So that helped them on the mix side of things.
It's in that ballpark.
I think, SAN was relatively flat in the quarter. So again, as Jerry said, most of the growth came from 100 gig.
I think as Jerry mentioned, we hope that not only capacity this quarter for QSFP28, but in subsequent quarters. So I think the hope would be that, that product continues to grow that the demand is there. And certainly that will be helpful as you look to the Q3 to Q4 comparison and certainly, we'll make it a lot easier for growth in the fourth quarter.
James, what was the second question?
Yes. I think, we said we expected it to more than double or are doubled.
To double again? No, I don't think it's going to double again next quarter. But it's going to grow significantly, as Jerry said. I think that will be -- 100 gig will be the key driver for growth this quarter.
Sure. So I'd say, first of all, I think what I said is historically, we typically been between 30 and 35%. But certainly, we've had quarters where we've been above that and were above that now. I think in terms of looking to the future, as I've always said, it comes down to revenue growth, product mix and the competitive environment. And so it's trying to predict multiple quarters out is challenging in our industry but obviously, we're very optimistic now and were very pleased with where our margins were last quarter and with our guidance this quarter, but we don't provide guidance beyond this quarter.
Yes. So we had a couple of lawsuits that happened when we went to trial in the first quarter, and that rolled off. And so I think, hopefully, that large expense is behind us. I mean, I do expect G&A to continue to grow, but I don't expect legal to, in the near term, to pop back up to the old levels. So I'd expect it to grow from the levels that we're at now over the subsequent quarters.
Yes. It's about 30% to 35% of the account.
Yes, it's kind of in the low 20s percent of datacom.
I think we've said in the past, that's 15% to 20% of revenue. And I still think it's in that ballpark.
It was about $30 million.
We're not getting into that, Dave. We're not at that stage yet.
And it will come down to volume at the end of the day, again, when you're looking at fixed costs to the extent once you add the capacity, it all comes down to how many units go down through that fixed cost.
It's still predominantly WSS. Obviously, once we get some of these calls down on line cards, we expect that to shift some, but it's predominantly WSS at this point still.","Thanks, Jerry. Sales of datacom products increased by $7.3 million or 2.8% compared to the second quarter. This increase is primarily due to higher sales of 100-gigabit transceivers. Sales of 100-gigabit transceivers for datacom applications increased approximately 9% compared to the second quarter and more than 110% over the third quarter of the prior fiscal year. Sales of telecom products increased by $3.5 million or 3.2% compared to the second quarter. This increase was due to higher sales of wavelength-selective switches and ROADM line cards, primarily to our Chinese OEM customers.


In the second quarter we had 2 10% or greater customers. Our top 10 customers represented 57.4% of total revenues compared to 57.9% in the second quarter.


Non-GAAP gross margin was 37% compared to 37.2% in the second quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $70.5 million compared to $69.4 million in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses as a percent of revenue decreased to approximately 18.5% of revenue compared to 18.8% in the second quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $70.4 million or 18.5% of revenues compared to $68.3 million or 18.5% of revenue in the second quarter. Non-GAAP operating -- non-GAAP income was $67.2 million or $0.59 per diluted share compared to $65.2 million or $0.58 in the preceding quarter.


Average diluted shares for non-GAAP purposes totaled 114.9.


Interest and other income was approximately $900,000 in the third quarter and is expected to be approximately $1.3 million in the fourth fiscal quarter.


Non-GAAP taxes for the third quarter were approximately $4.1 million. Non-GAAP taxes for the fourth fiscal quarter are estimated to be approximately 5%. Non-GAAP taxes for fiscal '18 are estimated at approximately 6%.


Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased by $588 million to one point -- approximately $1.2 billion at the end of the third quarter compared to $626.3 million at the end of the second quarter. This increase is primarily due to the issuance of $575 million of 0.5% convertible notes due in December 2036, which yielded net proceeds of $569.3 million. Excluding those net proceeds, cash would have increased $18.7 million during the quarter.


Capital expenditures were approximately $42 million in the third quarter and are expected to be approximately $50 million in the fourth fiscal quarter. The increase in capital expenditures in the fourth quarter will be driven by the expansion of capacity in our VCSEL laser fab in Allen, Texas to enable us to pursue new 3D sensing opportunities for consumer applications. In addition, at the beginning of the fourth quarter, we acquired the rights to a parse of land adjacent to our current manufacturing facility in Wuxi, China. In the fourth quarter, we expect to start the construction of a building on this site, whose primarily use will be manufacturing. We expect the construction of this building will be completed in the second half of calendar 2018.


Capital expenditures for fiscal '18 are estimated to be approximately $35 million to $40 million per quarter. Weighted average fully diluted shares for the fourth fiscal quarter are expected to be approximately 115.5 million for non-GAAP purposes. Excluded from our non-GAAP results a number of charges or benefits that were either noncash or we consider outside of our core ongoing operating results. These totaled $20.8 million last quarter. If you included all these items as required under GAAP, we generated net income of $46.4 million or $0.40 per diluted share compared to net income of $48.8 million or $0.43 per diluted share in the second quarter.


The concludes my comments and I'll turn it back to Jerry.
I think the second thing is, as Jerry mentioned in his comments, is we expect revenue to grow again starting in the first quarter, and I think that's different. I think this is -- obviously, we've had -- we sold less than we expected this quarter and the guidance is lower than we had expected, but we do expect fiscal '18 to be a strong year for all the reasons Jerry talked about.
So Doug, can you clarify? You keep referring to them as qualification issues. I think Jerry alluded, we've got some technical issues on the CFP with a couple of customers that we're working through, but can you be more specific on your question?
Well, again, I don't think we're get into that level of detail. It's a little hard to break it out in terms of the impact of the technical challenges with those customers versus -- we have seen just in general some slower demand in CFP, I think, that others have also talked about around Chinese New Year and expect in the first half of the year. So it's a little hard to quantify just the impact of that. But obviously, it's something that we hope to resolve shortly and get shipping on those again. But in the meantime, 100-gig QSFP continues to grow at an incredible rate for us. And as Jerry said, we expect to continue that capacity and be sold out this year, and that's really going to be the growth driver for the company.
Well, I think -- it's certainly -- there's a lot of factors that go into that. I think Jerry just finished talking about the 3D sensing opportunity, and that could have a major impact and really add to our revenue. So I think it all depends on how aggressive you want to be on your assumptions on that, but we're not at the point where we're willing to quantify that. So -- but certainly, I think there's a lot of reasons why we're optimistic about FY '18 that Jerry talked, starts with the QSFP28 sensors, some of the Metro products going into Verizon, and then still WSS domestically in China. So lots of reasons to be positive and expect significant growth in fiscal '18.
Well, I think -- again, I think we talked about 10-gig and lower short wave being down, and I think that's a combination of several things. I think it is a little bit of the wireless, as you talked about, Alex, but it's also we do see in 1-gig Ethernet and 10-gig Ethernet being down this quarter. So you're right, there's still -- wireless is a couple of percent low single-digit percent. Certainly, as a percent of the business, we expect it to decline just because it's not really going, but there will be opportunities down the road, maybe not in the near term, to come out with next-generation products and be more aggressive in that market. But I think certainly, in the near term, it's a flat to declining market and certainly, a smaller and smaller percent of our revenue as most of our growth is driven by QSFP28.
Well, I'd say that -- I would say it was slightly down. So I think all that growth really came from WSS last quarter.
I think the main driver, to your point, Alex, is the WSS.
Well, I mean, I think it was -- no, I think if you factor in pricing, it was probably flat on units if you assumed you got the 1-month average pricing right.  So...
Well, I think as we always talk about, we only give one quarter gross margin guidance, but gross margin is a big -- the big factor for gross margin are revenue growth, product mix and, obviously, the competitive environment. So we are very excited, as Jerry talked about, about some of these VCSEL 3D sensing applications. And obviously, depending on growth and volume, that can be quite nice for us, so that can be helpful. And QSFP28, as that grows, is -- on average, has a higher gross margin than our average gross margin. So again, Wavelength Selective Switch tends to be a favorable product mix. So we have lots of opportunities out there that we're pursuing that could be additive to margin, and that will obviously have to be balanced by what's going on in the competitive market.
Well, I think as Jerry said, for the ROADM line cards and the ACOs with a key OEM and Verizon, we're not going get -- we don't expect to be qualified until Q1, so there's not going to be material revenue in Q4 for that.
Well, I mean, there's a lot of questions in your question. I think the simple answer is the place where we have the most visibility in this business is -- and we think is the biggest growth driver is QSFP28, which is datacom. So we expect datacom growth to be strong in fiscal '18. I think when you look at some of these opportunities that Jerry talks about, whether it's wavelength selective switches and -- domestically in China or the Metro deployments at Verizon, obviously, if we go and we execute on those, where we really haven't sold WSS in China domestically or have these quals, then that's a greenfield opportunity and that can add a lot to that to it. But as we've seen, there are some risk on the timing on those. And so I'd say we're most confident, actually, probably on the datacom side because we really do believe QSFP28, the demand is very strong or expected to continue to be strong, and we are adding significant capacity throughout the fiscal year. And so we really think that's going to be the #1 driver for us.
Yes. I mean, I don't have all this, the breakdown of the revenue this year versus last year. I mean, obviously, last year, we had -- we were at the higher end of the 10% to 15% range for annual ASP reduction , so I think that had more impact last year. I think this year, as we talked about it, it's obviously the -- that the price erosion, although, again, that was at the lower end this year, but then as Jerry mentioned, we expect to sell less CFP modules -- 100-gig CFP modules into China, partially driven by some of these technical issues that we're working through right now that we hope to have resolved by the end of the quarter and start to see the benefit of having those resolved next fiscal year.
Well, I don't know, first of all, if I'd call Q3, where we grew about 3%, a mess, but certainly, as Jerry pointed out, Q3 was a little lighter than expected. It was primarily because 100-gig CFP into China was less than expected. I think that was the result, partially because we thought there were going to be some orders in the last week just prior to Chinese New Year that didn't happen. And then secondly, as Jerry's already talked about, we had some technical glitches that we're working through, and that affected that sale. I mean, that's the story on Q3. I think the story on Q4 is, again, we continue to have -- we're still working through those technical issues. We think that it will get resolved, hopefully, by the end of the quarter, but obviously, it's affecting Q4. And I think also, as we talked about, there's kind of the typical Q4 seasonality issues that are out there, both in terms of Chinese New Year, but also in terms of the price erosion. So if we -- I don't think it's that big a difference. Obviously, we're disappointed, but at the same time, we're very optimistic about FY '18. And if we resolve these issues and we continue to grow QSFP28 and some of these other things start to kick in, in the second half of the year, we think FY '18 can be a very good year. So..."

Comments,"Thank you, Cassandra, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your taking the time to listen to our conference call today. The replay of this call should appear on our website within 8 hours. An audio replay will be available for 2 weeks by calling area code (888) 203-1112 for domestic, or area code (719) 457-0820 for international, then enter the ID number 7685228.


I need to remind all of you that any forward-looking statements in today's discussion are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are discussed at length in our annual and quarterly SEC filings. Actual events and results can differ materially from any forward-looking statements. As a result, any forward-looking statements are subject to sudden and dramatic changes. In addition, the company undertakes no obligations to update information presented in forward-looking statements. In addition, unless otherwise indicated, all results discussed are on a non-GAAP basis. A complete reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results may be found in our earnings press release and in the Investor Relations section of our website.


We have prepared some slides for today's conference call. You can access them by connecting to the Investor Relations page of our website at finisar.com. Click on Investors, then scroll down to Webcast Archives and click. You'll see a listing for today's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call.


I am pleased to report that our first quarter revenues were $327.6 million, a new all-time record for Finisar. Quarterly revenues increased by $21.6 million or 7.1% over the previous quarter. Our quarterly revenues increased for the eighth consecutive quarter.


And now with that, I'll let Kurt Adzema, review the rest of the numbers. Kurt?
Thanks, Eitan. As Eitan mentioned, we expect a dip in demand for transceivers for Wireless applications in our second fiscal quarter. As a result of this decrease, as well as soft demand from several datacom and telecom customers, we expect our overall revenues to decline to between $305 million and $320 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margins to be between 31% and 32%. This is a result of lower revenues, an increase in depreciation of approximately $2 million, and the impact of the annual employee salary increases, which took effect at the beginning of the second fiscal quarter.


Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to increase approximately $1 million primarily as the result of the impact of our employees' annual salary increases and higher legal expenses from multiple patent litigations. We expect non-GAAP operating margins to be approximately 8.5% to 9.5% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $0.23 to $0.27 per share.


While we are disappointed with the near-term revenue outlook for our second quarter, we continue to believe in the long-term growth prospects of the company. Finisar's revenue is driven primarily by growth in the worldwide demand for bandwidth from the ever-increasing distribution and use of video images and digital information. Another important trend that is benefiting us is the growth in cloud services, which drives networking hardware upgrades, and the build-out of new hyperscale data centers. These large data centers need many more optical connections, providing terrific opportunities for Finisar products. We believe Finisar is uniquely positioned with our broad product line, extensive customer engagements, profitable vertically integrated business model and strong balance sheet to capitalize on these market opportunities.
And now with that, I'm going to turn it back over to Cassandra and open it up for questions. Cassandra?

Question and Answer
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................
With respect to 100G Ethernet as a driver, particularly the CFP2, it is obviously, for us a very exciting product. It is an exciting product transition. And we have -- I won't tell you every -- probably every single user of CFP1 100G is now qualifying CFP2 100G. And so it's going to be a very nice transition for the industry, for us as a company. It's started. We are shipping all the CFP2s that we can make today, I won't say that we are in full-bore production, but we are shipping thousands of units And I predict that 100G Ethernet is going to be a growth driver probably not in our Q2 but I would think in -- later in this fiscal year, we will see increased activity and revenue growth at 100G.
Both of those are hard to predict right now because the CFP is going to have a life that will go on for several years. There are a lot of slots that have been created for it in all sorts of systems and some of those slots are empty. They will be filled on network expansion and the network expansion projects in future periods. So I don't know exactly when the crossover of CFP2 dollar volume or unit volume is greater than CFP. I would hope that we ought to have 100G Ethernet revenues back to our -- or close to our record levels in our fiscal year '16 probably. I would guess fiscal year '16.
We don't believe this optics -- You were saying this was a bad business. We don't think optics is a bad business. We think there's a bright future to it. There's -- this is all of the uses for higher-speed optical connections to deliver information. They're not decreasing. They're increasing at a pretty rapid rate. Now it doesn't -- it's not always straight up. We've had quarters in the past where we have either had flat or declining revenues, but we recovered from that and we came back. So I'm still very optimistic about the optics industry and about our role in it and our place in it.
We get premiums when we deliver products that have extraordinary performance. And we go through product cycles where we deliver extraordinary performance and we generate premiums for our products. However, it's a very competitive industry and over time, we have competitors who fall in line, who develop competing products, who have similar performance characteristics. And sometimes that takes a year and sometimes it takes 3 years. But nevertheless, we always find ourselves in that position. So our job is to continue to fund research and development projects, to develop new -- a higher performance, cutting-edge products that do give us a performance edge and higher margins. And so we'll go through several cycles and when we go through those cycles, you'll see our margins -- our margins should come back up like they have in the past.
You're talking about in the second quarter?
It's hard for me to distinguish between those businesses because some -- what's Enterprise and what's hyper data center and what's Web 2.0 and lots of some of the same products end up in all those different places. In general, we predict that we're -- our business is going to be soft again in the datacom sector driven mostly by the Wireless. I think most of the other products are going to be, I don't know, they may be up a bit or maybe down a bit but I think the impact is mostly on the -- in the Wireless.
And yes, we do expect that the datacom business is going to be stronger in the second half of this year and into the next fiscal year. So we -- we think long-term, that business at 10G, 40G, 100G, 200G will come after that. I mean, there's a whole progression of faster and faster connections and more and more optical in these data centers. So we're pretty optimistic about that whole sector.
Yes.
I don't think that's affecting us. It's an opportunity where one of our competitors were successful in selling a proprietary solution. There's an exclusive arrangement involved with that product. And it's one that we currently don't offer. But I think we will have some technical solutions that will be equivalent, that we will be offering in very short order. So I'm -- but I don't think that, that has affected any kind of meaningful shift that affects our revenues.
Well we don't give specific guidance for the third and fourth quarter. And if you remember, our datacom business is served almost totally from customer-managed inventory hubs. They are just-in-time hubs where the customers pull the product and just-in-time delivery for their shipments. So our visibility in a traditional sense because looking at backlog, we have -- it doesn't exist. So -- but I will tell you that our customers are optimistic. Now, will that optimism for our third and fourth quarters turn into pulls out of those hubs and it will turn into revenue for us? Well, generally, our customers in the past when they have been optimistic, yes, it did turn into revenue. So we're -- we feel pretty good about it.
Well, we're shipping a lot -- as many as we can make right now. And the real issue is, most of those are going into early systems and design efforts and system tests that are being done by the system builders. So what they have to do is they've got to get their systems designed. They've got to get them fully vetted and qualified and then go into production for general availability. Then we have a production stream that produces parts for those. And we don't think that production stream -- it's increasing quarterly, but my guess is it's not till the end of the fiscal year, at least the end of the calendar year, before we really start seeing that product ramp in any -- in a big way.
Yes. We think we're spending CapEx for the right reason and that's to expand capacity. Because we think our customers are going to demand that capacity from us. And if you look at our revenues, I mean, there have been -- all the sequential growth of our revenues for the last 8 quarters is -- I don't know. We've been on quite a unit run, as well as a revenue dollar run that has demanded more capacity out of our factories. So we're -- I think we're spending money in the right place.
Let's see. We've got -- we have -- as you pointed out, there a number of -- and in fact some of them are not 100G, some of them are 300G. So we are -- some of these board-mounted optical engines have enormous bandwidth for a very small size of the device. We are working in most of these areas on relatively new developments, whether they be totally new systems on the part of the manufacturer, or in some cases big, new supercomputers. I would expect that -- I mean, I still expect that in our next fiscal year for sure, our 100G Ethernet business overall is going to be bigger than it ever has been in the past. But can it be as a result of some of these other products, could it be larger even sooner? And the answer is maybe. But on -- I don't know what I would necessarily predict.
Let's see, pricing. Pricing varies sector-to-sector, country-to-country. It's all over the place in some sense. But it's a competitive industry. It always has been a competitive industry. And prices don't ever go up. So that's just a fact that we live with and the only issue is, do they go down faster in 1 quarter than they do in another quarter or 1 year more than they did in the previous year. Right now, I would say the market in China is particularly competitive because there's a lot of domestic Chinese suppliers that supply there and are qualified to supply there. So that's probably the toughest pricing environment that we face right now. I think in the rest of our -- in the rest of the markets -- telecom, we're about to go through an annual price negotiation that will come in this fall for effect in calendar year '15. So I don't yet know how that's going to turn out. In our broad datacom Enterprise as well as the hyper data center activity, all of that is -- are price negotiations or are purchase order negotiations on a shorter-term basis, typically, quarterly or every 6 months. There's nothing in general, nothing extraordinary that's going on in pricing or competition there. So it's...
Well, I think it's about the same as we see. An increase in revenues over our historical levels in 100G Ethernet. So if that happens in this -- late this fiscal year or early in the next fiscal year, I think that -- I think we would expect not only revenues to be at record levels, but we would also expect the profit contributions to be there.
That's not right.
Dmitry, I'll talk a little bit about the datacom opportunities and I'm going to let Eitan work on telecom. From our standpoint, we don't think we have exhausted the opportunities in datacom at all. We think there are many exciting opportunities still in the 40G, 100G and even faster. And many, many different form factors: the CFP2, the CFP4, the QSFP. We are still very optimistic that the datacom market is -- it provides a lot of opportunities for an optics company like us. So we are investing record, record dollars in R&D on a record number of projects for us to support a really big customer base. So Eitan, you want to talk about this telecom side?
Cassandra, thank you. And I thank everyone else for tuning in today. We appreciate your time. And we hope that you will be able to tune in 3 months from now as we have our second quarter call. Good day.","Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your taking the time to listen to our conference call today.

I need to remind all of you that any forward-looking statements in today's discussion are subject to risks and uncertainties which are discussed at length in our annual and quarterly SEC filings. Actual events and results can differ materially from any forward-looking statements. In addition, the company undertakes no obligations to update any forward-looking information presented. Unless otherwise indicated, all results discussed are on a non-GAAP basis. A complete reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results may be found in our earnings press release, and in the Investor Relations section of our website. We have prepared some slides for today's earnings call. You can view them by connecting to the Investor Relations page of our website at finisar.com, click on Investors, then scroll down to webcast archives and click. You'll see a listing for today's second quarter 2015 earnings call.


Revenues for our second fiscal quarter were $297 million, an increase of $6.3 million compared to the second fiscal quarter of 2014, but a decrease of $30.7 million or 9.4% from the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2015.


The second quarter was challenging. During the quarter, we experience decreased demand from both the telecom and datacom markets. Telecom suffered from sluggish carrier capital expenditures. And datacom saw decreased sales of transceivers for wireless applications. In addition, datacom revenues declined due to lumpy orders from a few large customers.


Now I'll let Kurt review the rest of the numbers. Kurt?
Thanks, Eitan. We expect our revenue to grow sequentially in the third fiscal quarter. This growth will primarily be driven by the demand for 40 gigabit and 100 gigabit datacom transceivers as well as transceivers for wireless applications. We expect revenues for our third quarter will be in the range of $297 million to $312 million.


We expect non-GAAP gross margins to be approximately 31% as the benefit from growth and revenues is offset by the impact of 1 month of the annual telecom price reductions that typically take effect on January 1. In addition, as Kurt pointed out earlier, depreciation will increase by approximately $1.5 million over Q2. As a reminder, our fourth quarter will have a full 3-months' impact of the annual telecom price reduction.


Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately flat with Q2, except the potential increase in sales and marketing due to higher revenue levels. Non-GAAP operating margins are expected to be approximately 8.4% to 9.4%.


Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share should be in the range of $0.23 to $0.27 per share. We continue to believe in the long-term growth prospects of the company. Finisar's revenue is driven primarily by the growth in worldwide demand for bandwidth with the ever-increasing distribution and use of video and other digital information.


In addition, Finisar continues to benefit from the growth in cloud services, which drives network hardware upgrades of existing data centers and the build-out of new hyperscale data centers. These large data centers need more high-speed optical connections. Over time we believe data centers and carriers will spend more money on optics to meet their needs for increased bandwidth. And we believe Finisar is uniquely positioned with our broad product line, extensive customer engagements, profitable vertically-integrated business model, and strong balance sheet to capitalize on these market opportunities.
And now, with that I'm going to turn it back over to Kevin and open it up for questions.

Question and Answer
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Well, we think our revenues are going to increase in our third quarter, and we're very about optimistic about the future beyond that. So we had some, I don't know, rough water in this last quarter. It was a tough quarter for us. But we're still very optimistic that the strength, in particular, in the datacom sector is going to drive our revenues higher. Telecom, I don't know. Maybe, Eitan, do you want to talk a little bit about metro upgrades and some of the spending we expect to come in 2015 and 2016 there?
You asked about CapEx.
Well, datacom is competitive. We have a number of competitors there. And has it really changed? We see a few more Chinese competitors than we've probably seen if we think about this year versus last year. But I don't -- I think one of the things that has occurred over the last several years is that we had a lot of success in terms of revenue growth in the datacom sector. And therefore, I think there's a number of competitors who, heretofore, had revenues mostly in telecom that are now trying to build products that can be sold into the datacom sector. So we expect competition to stay rigorous, but I don't think it's going to be dramatically different than what it has been in the past.
Let's see. Consolidation. I think it's a good thing. We have thought for a long time that we have -- there's more companies in our industry that are doing research and development on the same products, and I don't think that's very efficient. And I think the industry in general would benefit from having a fewer number of competitors. So if we could consolidate or if this industry could consolidate into a more efficient sector, it would be good for all of us, I think.
The other thing you asked about, Subu, was revenue being lumpy and where was that? Well, it was from customers who have construction projects that consume a lot of optics.
Yes.
We're starting to ship more of the CFP2. We have -- but our revenues are still a lot more in CFP than they are in CFP2. And our revenues overall in the 100 gig Ethernet are growing and we expect them to continue to grow.
My guess is you've got some of everything that's rolled in there. We've got some that's lumpy because we sell a lot of it into the big data centers. We have some that goes into wireless, and as we've said, wireless was weak in the quarter. And our prices never go up. So they always come down a little bit, so there's always some impact of pricing in there.
I think 10 gig will continue to grow for several years. 10 gigabit will be -- for the enterprise data centers will be the predominant speed for all the new switches that are going to be used in enterprise networking. Now 40 gig is predominantly used by the Web 2.0 mega data centers or hyperscale data centers. And I think the growth rate in 40 gig is clearly going to be faster on a percentage basis than 10 gig will.
Well, we sell our 40 gig QSFP products to a number of companies. But mostly, they're in the Web 2.0 space as opposed to the OEM space. And the typical uses are for top-of-rack switch to the aggregation switch connections. So you're coming out with multiple -- but it's about density in that you've got 10 gig lanes, but in a single port, you now can put 4 10-gig lanes in a single plug-in, whereas before it was 1 10-gig lane per plug-in. So it's increasing the density of the bit density of the switch, and it's mostly switch-to-switch connections.
I think it's going to be a very healthy ramp as we move through 2015. And not everybody in the space has made the move from 10 gigabit to 40 gigabit yet. So there are still others yet to move.
I think you're right on. Consolidation occurs when you have the number of participants actually decrease in number. In this particular case with the Koch Industries acquisition, you're not -- we're not decreasing the number of participants. They just have a different ownership. But I do think it's very exciting that a deep-pockets investment group like the Koch brothers would choose the optics industry as a place to put billions of their dollars at work.
With respect to datacom in 2015 and beyond, I think that the good thing about growth is that it happens at the highest speeds. And yes, though there may be some competitors who appear in the market that weren't there a couple of years ago, most of them offer products that are not cutting-edge. And so when we gain market share and historically have gained market share, most of that comes not because we were knocking off new equipment companies in the industry, and mostly became -- because as the speeds move higher, we were there with products and we actually had fewer competitors at the higher speeds. So I think it's very possible that we would continue to gain market share in datacom.
Well, yes. I mean, China is the big market, and so that's where the most of the volume is.
Well, we think 40 gig overall is going to grow for quite a while. So we're very positive on the sector. We're adding capacity. Some of that CapEx that Kurt talked about is headed in that direction. In the quarter, the lumpiness had to do with project pauses. And one of the things about the mega data center, hyper data center market is that they are construction projects, and they're subject to construction delays and all of the pieces coming together at the right time. And sometimes it isn't perfect.
I'm not sure that we could tell you exactly what all the sources of weakness are. There was a supply chain problem with one of the ICs, the critical ICs. But we have also, we've also heard feedback from China that said there was inventory correction because there was too much inventory at some of the -- at not only the big carriers but also some of the equipment companies. So they sound a little bit inconsistent to say, wait a minute, we've slowed down because we've got a supply chain, but also our inventories are too high so we've got a correction. But one of the problems is that there's always a bit of mystery when you're dealing with China. It's just a little different than sort of our traditional business in the U.S.
No, I do think so. I don't think any of the competitive aspects of that business are affecting the projects. Projects are mostly related to construction, sometimes weather, transportation, lots of things that can contribute to that. And overall, I can't -- with respect to the economics of the cloud services business, it's a little difficult for us to understand exactly how lucrative that business is for all of the participants right now. I mean, it is obviously, the expectations are very high. But the amount of money that is being spent on the expansion in that industry is unbelievable. So is the spending proportional to the opportunity? I don't know. I think, Ted, we're going to have to depend on analysts like you to go do the calculations.
Well, the forecasts that we've read would say -- or have said, that there's something in the order of 2 million towers that are required to do a 4G upgrade in China. And in the last year, they did a 200,000 tower upgrade, and now it's a few hundred thousand more. But at that rate, it's going to take another 2 years at least, maybe 3. And it depends a lot on the political winds in China because a lot of the spending is driven by national priorities, and that's a little hard to predict sometimes.
Well, by then we hope our 100 gig CFP2 coherent is now a big success in the market and we get a big market share, and we think that's going to help a lot. We think that there's still fourth generation upgrades of wireless in the rest of the world. I mean, China is leading the world right now, but there's still a lot of 3G towers in the rest of the world where upgrades are coming. And I don't know when -- fifth generation is out there ahead of us somewhere. Now it's few years away I think, but there is discussions, planning, experiments, hardware, lots of things going on that -- where people are planning the next wireless generation, which will be even higher bandwidth.
Sure.
Let's see. With respect to your Cisco question, Cisco is our largest customer. They have been for a long time and they're a very good customer, a successful company. And as you pointed out, the softness in our datacom business in the last quarter was predominantly Web 2.0.
I don't know what our market share is in 40 gig datacom. I guess I'd have to look at -- dig up the Infonetics, our Infonetics or LightCounting or one of those industry analysts and see what they had to say. But off the top of my head, I don't know what it is.
Yes. I mean the answer is, for 40 gig, we've had more orders than we were able to deliver, so it's still pretty strong demand.
Well, we have seen, historically, competition that came from Chinese suppliers, where most of it appeared in the gray market. It was counterfeits, knockoffs, what were known as compatibles, where the security codes from the big OEMs were programmed into these devices. Some of them -- and many of them even came with counterfeit labels that said they were from a big OEM. So that was a big sale of things from China. In the last couple of years, we have seen more inroads, if that's the right word, more companies making sales calls anyway, at least in some of the data center users that were companies from China. So I think that's -- and some of those were 10 gigabit. So that's -- and I don't think that that's really surprising because most of the Chinese competitors are usually a couple of generations behind wherever our latest product is. And the 10-gig product has been out there for several years.
Well, I thank you, Kevin, and I appreciate your help. And my thanks to everyone for tuning in today. We hope that you will come back in 3 months and join us again.

Revenues for our just completed third fiscal quarter were $306.3 million, an increase of $9.3 million over the prior quarter. Revenue growth was primarily driven by the demand for 40 gigabit and 100 gigabit transceivers for datacom applications as well as transceivers for fourth generation wireless base station installations.


And now, with that, I'll let Kurt review the rest of the numbers. Kurt?
Well, as you point out, that market is still going strong. There are an awful lot of 40 gig transceivers in the QSFP form factor that are being consumed by a number of the big cloud services operators and it's a competitive market. It's like all the markets that we participate in. It has a number of competitors and it's all about performance. It's all about economics. So I don't know how to describe it much differently than that.
Well, the telecom pricing pressure comes mostly at the end of the calendar year where we have negotiations with the big equipment companies for prices that go for a yearly -- for 12 months. There are a few exceptions to that, but for the most part, we negotiate sort of 12-month agreements in the telecom business. So that's behind us now.
Let's see. Our crossover for CFP2 to CFP is -- we're not quite there, but we're almost there. And we had substantial growth in CFP2, but we also had -- we had a very good quarter for the CFPs.
I don't really have a lot of good data on that one. Just a minute. We don't see much of it, but I know that they're being sold, so I don't -- and I couldn't comment on the volumes. I couldn't comment on the impact, if there is an impact on our business. And I just don't know.
Well, we continue to believe that consolidation is important in our industry, and it would be attractive to achieve consolidation. But with respect to JDSU, or any other company, I don't think we have any particular comments to make.
Well, one of the frustrations of that Web 2.0 sector is all of the revenue that goes into it, at least from our end, is sort of dependent upon construction projects. And the construction projects have many facets. There's physical structure, there's electrical distribution, there's air-conditioning, there's the wiring, there's all the hardware that goes in. And if any one of those runs late, then the whole project runs late and you get -- and our optics after you got all the stuff in place get plugged in, and now you connect everything. So forecasting has been a challenge, because our customers in these construction projects have been challenged with having predictable schedules. And so I -- the business is strong, the market has still a lot of demand, percentage growth maybe slower in the future than it has been in the past, I've read predictions like that. But the absolute magnitude of the growth is greater than it has been in the past and -- or are expected to be. So it's a big market becoming a much bigger market. So we're still paying a lot of attention there. And we just wish that there was a little less volatility, if that's the right word, in the shipment patterns that we have with the big 2.0 operators.
Let's see. Datacom, in general, I would say the enterprise part of the business is mostly 10 gigabit Ethernet, and 10 gigabit Ethernet continues to be a good product, and revenues we expect for the quarter will be up a bit in that sector. It's not the 100 gig and 40 gig have pretty specific targets but they're not really enterprise. They tend to be hyperscale or the client sides of routers. But overall enterprise seems to be doing well with moderate growth rates. The Fibre Channel sector, I mean, it's again not a rapidly growing sector overall. But one of the things that we're seeing now is much more rapid take of 16 gig Fibre Channel. Most of our shipments for several years now have been 8 gigabit Fibre Channel. And the 16 gig was sort of limited to the switch makers. But now we're starting to ship 16 gigabit Fibre Channel to a number of the equipment suppliers of the storage arrays and host bus adapters, et cetera. So we expect that 16 gig will be greater than 8 gig shipments here, probably within the next year.
Oh, Avago and  Emulex. I don't have -- I don't really have a view of that one. Emulex has been a good customer of ours for a long time. On the other hand, now we -- Avago is a competitor in that datacom space. And so my guess is that there's going to be some decisions that have to be made there. But in general, any customer, anyone of the equipment companies wants to have at least 2 sources of supply even if one is internal. So I would expect that we will still have ongoing relationship with Emulex.
We think so, but nobody told us exactly. It's been a -- there's an element of security and maybe you can even say secrecy that goes with some of the Web 2.0 competitors. I mean, the competitive guys that are in the Web 2.0 business building out these data centers and they're trying to protect information about their business and their activities. So it's not always that we have very specific information about why is our business going up or why was our business going down. In this case it was going up, so. And to follow up...
Well, the biggest change over that period when our gross margins have gone from 37% to 30% has been in 100 gig Ethernet. If you recall, if we go back a 1.5 years ago, we had virtually, I don't know, if we didn't have 100% of the market, we had 85% or 90% of the market. We were an early entry. We had a CFP 100 gig LR4 device that was fully functional. It contained an IC set that we designed here at Finisar and there were no other functional ICs in the industry. And so our sales were growing very rapidly, our margins were exceptionally high. We were on allocation for several quarters. And -- but all that came to an end as merchant semiconductor companies were able to correct the errors in their chips and produce functional chips, and so then a number of competitors were empowered. They entered the market at substantially lower prices and so we had -- our prices had to come down to be competitive. So that has been the largest impact on our margins over the last year, 1.5 years.
Yes.
It's still the same.
Let's see. CFP2 is going to be an exciting product area. It is exciting for us right now in that we are shipping everything we can build. If we could double our output, we could sell double our output. But we are increasing our capacity. Demand is strong. Equipment companies are designing blades that have CFP2 ports because they can double the density on their blades. And I think it's an exciting market. Now the margins there will never be as high as they were with our original CFP because we have competitors and in CFP, we were the only game in town. So -- but the margins are quite good. I mean, it's not like, it's a bad product. It's a good product and we think the demand is going to be strong as the equipment companies convert their boxes to having these high density blades. I mean, there's still a lot of ports for CFP. There's a lot of ports even that are being shipped from the OEMs, but there's a lot of ports in the field that are -- that were shipped where blades were not fully populated and for the expansion of networks at -- in central offices. They continue to buy CFPs and plug them in the CFP slots. So we're going to see CFP revenue for quite some time but CFP2 is clearly growing faster.
Higher. CFP2 is higher than the corporate average.
All of the above. I mean, any consolidation move could accomplish any one of those things or multiple of them. And the more of factors that you could make positive contribution through some acquisition, I mean, that makes it more attractive. That means there's more value there, so.
Thanks, everybody, for tuning in today. We appreciate your time and your attention, and we hope you're going to join us again 3 months from now. Good day.","It's mostly in the datacom space.
I would say it's both single mode and multimode.
Well, hyperscale data centers are a little bit different than enterprise in that they often will accept products that are ""good enough"" and don't necessarily have to meet all of the industry specifications, the Bellcore specs, et cetera. And so that means that they will accept offerings from less than Tier 1 companies. And so it's a -- there is a bit more competitive pressures that go into that space. And so -- but nevertheless, we expect to maintain our market share. We're the largest supplier in the world and we're the largest supplier into that space. And I -- our expectations are that we will be -- we will absolutely be competitive and we're going to maintain our market share.
It's lumpiness. We expect that 40 Gb is going to be very strong next quarter. We had one particular customer who we expected to ship more to, and they had predicted but they -- part of the lumpiness of their acceptance pattern shifted out to the next quarter.
Well, it's both strength in CFP and CFP2. We still sell more CFP and there's more CFP slots out there to fill than there are CFP2. But as you might expect, more and more hardware designs are being created with CFP2 sockets. So we think over the next year or 2, CFP2 is going to continue to increase and it will eventually overtake CFP. But right now, they're both alive, well and doing -- and strong in revenue and -- but still, CFP is larger.
It's 10 Gb, it's wireless. And it's 40 Gb as well because remember, 40 Gb is really 4 lanes of 10 Gb, so the basic technology is still 10 Gb technology and it's not at 100 Gb.
It will happen in the second half of this year as well start seeing much more 100 Gb 4x25 in data centers, and I think it will be really exciting in the calendar year '16. And overall, that data center market is still the fastest-growing segment in all of optics, so it is quite an opportunity.
Well, we expect that our datacom business is going to continue to grow; and we expect that it's going to be the strongest part of our business, led by hyperscale or Web 2.0 data centers. But the challenge in that space is that there aren't hundreds of customers. There are a handful of customers, and each one of them has their own characteristics of forecasting, accepting delivery, et cetera, and they often are related to construction projects, which have at least historically been pretty lumpy in terms of their sort of stops and starts or unexpected delays.
Book-to-bill is above 1. Visibility in datacom is -- it varies some. Most of our customers, particularly enterprise customers, are -- we operate on just-in-time hubs. And so we have, by classic definition, no visibility. On the day they want the product, they pull it out of the hub. They send us an electronic notice. We ship them an electronic invoice and the transaction is complete. But there was no visibility beyond the fact that they had given us a forecast and that we had inventory there available to pull. With the Web 2.0 group, we have some inventory hubs that we provide, but much of it is on orders that are shipped based on a purchase order. So there's a little visibility there, but it varies. But overall in datacom, visibility is limited to what our customers tell us they're going to pull or they're going to take.
Most of them, almost all, are taking 40 Gb products. All will take 100 Gb products.
I think it's an architecture decision. It's sort of what switches did they buy? What servers did they buy? What are the slots that they've invested in? And then what is their transition plan to transition to the next faster piece of equipment? And I think there's a number of them that are -- there's been lots of publicity about Broadcom and their Tomahawk chipset and its availability in the second half of this year and systems that will actually be built and deployed with it. So that will provide 100 Gb ports and multiples of 25. It's 4x25. So it's mostly architectural.
We wouldn't invest all that money in that beautiful new factory in China if we didn't think it was going to help. So...
We're going to be in that business as long as we can make money in that business. And if the day comes when prices get so low that we say ""It's not profitable to continue"", then we'll stop. But generally, we have a lot of capacity and when there's a lot of demand, we can sell our capacity and get a reasonable price for it.
Product mix is always probably the most important factor probably followed by volume.
But we're excited also about a whole series of products that are based on lane rates of 25 gigabits or 28 gigabits. So multiples of 25, 4x25 is 100. 12x25 is 300. There's a number of products that will use the 25 gigabit technology to provide really enormous bandwidth. And our product portfolio in that area, I don't -- there are a number of products that will be introduced here over the next 6 to 9 months.
You're asking about intra data center? That means inside the data center?
Yes, well, it's going to develop rapidly. As equipment is deployed, it has 100 Gb slots for optics to plug into. It will develop -- it will follow those switches and those servers. It's going to have -- it's going to start in a big way in the second half of this calendar year and we'll go into next fiscal year -- or next calendar year we expect it to be a very strong and very robust market.
PSM4 probably is next year. That single mode, most of -- a lot of the offerings that we're going to have in the space will be single mode in LR4 or will be multimode in SR4, 4SR as they refer to it.
Well, in the data center market, market share leaders for years have been Finisar and Avago and I don't -- that hasn't changed. But in the Web 2.0 space, there's a number of new entrants that are at least offering products there some more successful than others. But I still think that I don't think market share in the datacom space has changed.
Yes.
We are a modestly or moderately acquisitive company. We've done, I think since our IPO, maybe 21 acquisitions. Most of them were pretty small. Most of them were for specific technologies. But -- and I am certain we will do more acquisitions in the future. Consolidation would be one motivation to do an acquisition, and I believe strongly in consolidation as an important part of a healthy market. But I can't predict when any consolidation transaction is likely to be available. So we're interested.
Most of our revenue comes today from a couple of customers, but we have a number of them that are lined up in the wings that are either in some stage of evaluation or qualification.
We have high hopes in this area because we think it is a pretty amazing product. To be able to supply as much bandwidth in a smaller package as these optical engines do, I think it's a very attractive packaging alternative for anybody building a system or building a motherboard. So we have -- our expectations are that we're going to see dramatic growth in this product line over the next couple of years, maybe forever. I mean, it's -- we just think that it's a product whose time has come and the applications for it are going to increase every year.
Well, I apologize for being muddled. We are optimistic about our business. We're building new factories because we think we're going to need the volumes. We expect that optics are going to continue to grow and the principal driver right now is the Web 2.0 space. And then next year, it's going to be big in telecom with all of the metro build-outs. So I apologize again. We don't want to be muddled. We are optimistic. So it's -- we don't give guidance beyond the next quarter and that's been our policy for a long time. So...
Thanks, Shannon, and thank you, everyone, who joined us today. We hope you'll all be able to join us again 3 months from now. Good day.
It's mostly in the datacom space.
I would say it's both single mode and multimode.
Well, hyperscale data centers are a little bit different than enterprise in that they often will accept products that are ""good enough"" and don't necessarily have to meet all of the industry specifications, the Bellcore specs, et cetera. And so that means that they will accept offerings from less than Tier 1 companies. And so it's a -- there is a bit more competitive pressures that go into that space. And so -- but nevertheless, we expect to maintain our market share. We're the largest supplier in the world and we're the largest supplier into that space. And I -- our expectations are that we will be -- we will absolutely be competitive and we're going to maintain our market share.
It's lumpiness. We expect that 40 Gb is going to be very strong next quarter. We had one particular customer who we expected to ship more to, and they had predicted but they -- part of the lumpiness of their acceptance pattern shifted out to the next quarter.

Thanks, Shannon, and thank you, everyone, who joined us today. We hope you'll all be able to join us again 3 months from now. Good day.","Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your taking the time to listen to our conference call today. A replay of this call should appear on our website within 8 hours. An audio replay will be available for 2 weeks by calling area code (888) 203-1112 for domestic, or area code (719) 457-0820 for international. Then, you enter the ID number 8055566.


I need to remind all of you that any forward-looking statements in today's discussion are subject to risks and uncertainties which are discussed at length in our annual and quarterly SEC filings. Actual events and results can differ materially from any forward-looking statements.


In addition, the company undertakes no obligations to update any forward-looking information presented. Unless otherwise indicated, all results discussed are on a non-GAAP basis. A complete reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results may be found in our earnings press release and in the Investor Relations section of our website.


We have prepared some slides for today's earnings call. You can view them by connecting to the Investor Relations page of our website at finisar.com, click on Investors, then scroll down and click on Webcast Archives. You'll see a listing for today's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call.


Before I begin the discussion of our first quarter results, let me review an announcement we made today. We announced the resignation of Chief Executive Officer and Director, Eitan Gertel. On behalf of the entire company, we thank Eitan for his contributions to Finisar. Since joining the company in 2008, in connection with the Optium merger, Eitan has played an important role in Finisar's success as the world's largest supplier of optical transceivers. We appreciate Eitan's leadership and the important initiatives he has driven for the company.


With Eitan's departure, I have assumed the title of Chief Executive Officer and will continue as the company's principal executive officer and as its Chairman.


Revenues for our first quarter of fiscal year 2016 were $314 million compared to $320 million in the prior quarter. However, the prior quarter had the benefit of an additional week for a total of 14 weeks versus Q1 which had 13 weeks. Taking that into consideration, the first fiscal quarter had a higher average weekly revenue than the prior quarter. This higher weekly revenue in Q1 was primarily from increased sales of 40 gigabit transceivers for datacom applications.


Now I'll turn it over to Kurt for a review of the numbers.
Thanks, Kurt. We expect revenues for our second quarter of fiscal year 2016 to be in the range of $304 million to $324 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margins to be approximately 30% as we continue to see a high level of competition. We have started taking actions to reduce our operating expense levels. We expect operating expenses to be approximately 21.4% of revenue in the second quarter as compared to 21.8% in the first quarter. Our target is to ultimately have operating expenses at approximately 20% of revenue. Our plan is to achieve this during the first half of fiscal 2017.


Non-GAAP operating margins in Q2 are expected to be approximately 8% to 9%. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $0.20 to $0.26 per share.


While we expect the remainder of fiscal 2016 to be challenging, we are optimistic about fiscal 2017. We expect to benefit from the ramp of many new products and associated revenue growth, driven by both data center construction and upgrades and the increased deployments of ROADMs and 100G coherent transceivers in the telecom/metro market. We continue to believe that the long-term growth prospects of our company and the optical communications industry are positive.


From our position as the industry leader, we will continue to develop the technology and the next generation of products for both the datacom and the telecom markets.


Finisar's revenue is driven primarily by growth in the global demand for bandwidth due to the increasing distribution and use of video, images and digital information. In addition, Finisar continues to benefit from the growth in cloud services, which drives networking hardware upgrades of existing data centers and the build-out of new hyperscale data centers.
And now, I'm going to turn it back over to Kevin and open it up for questions. Kevin?

Question and Answer
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eitan's resignation resulted from a decision made mutually by him and the Board of Directors. Eitan -- it had nothing to do with performance or any particular event or circumstance. Just the Board and Eitan agreed to effect this transition now. We appreciated Eitan. I like Eitan. He made valuable contributions to the company and we're grateful for that. But with the second part of your question, it doesn't affect any of the programs that were related to the telecom market. We're still very enthusiastic about our development of line cards, our development of 100G Coherent tranceivers, the whole family of wavelength selective switches. This is -- those are all still important initiatives for the company.
Well, what we said was that we expected that our fiscal year '17 would be stronger. And we were optimistic about it. Our fiscal year '17 starts on May 1. Our fiscal year '16 ends on April 30. So it's a little earlier than you suggested. But we're still -- it's all about 100G in the data center. It's about the 25G rollout and all of the 25G I/O that's related to switches and servers. That's really important, that's coming. One of the things that has happened though in the last quarter, since I last spoke to you, anyway, was that -- is that we have heard that the major telecom metro upgrade has been pushed out another quarter and is now, appears to be a second half of calendar year '16 event. So there's a little delay in some of the revenue opportunities.
I don't think there's any important change in that. I think it still exists. It is still a part of the industry that we have to deal with and it's -- I think it's reality, and -- but it's not different than our products have been for a decade. The lower end products always affect competition from non-Tier 1 companies. And in some period of time, it just takes -- whether it's a 1 year or a 3-year, whatever the period, they -- Tier 2 competitors always catch up. So...
Well, OpEx -- the biggest part of our operating expenses are in fact R&D. But we still spend a lot of money in G&A and we spend a lot of money in sales and marketing and all the administrative kinds of things. And so we're just trying to tighten up in all of those areas to make sure we're as efficient as we possibly can be. And if you're -- as Alex pointed out, our earnings have declined. And one of the things we're trying to do is turn that around. We are spending more money on R&D than any other company in this industry by a lot. And I'm -- I think we are spending sufficient dollars to invest in technology and product development. So it's -- we're -- we remain committed to R&D as the lifeblood of the company.
For us, the answer is, move products through the development cycle at a faster pace, and we're trying to evaluate all of the hurdles and the chokepoints that we have in the product development cycle and try -- how we ease those. But we're not considering to diversify into the hamburger business or any other unrelated business. We're committed to optical communications. That's what we do well. That's what we have the most talented workforce and pool of engineers in the world. And we're going to continue to exploit that.
Data center, I can't tell you necessarily what total data center spending is. I can tell you what -- our -- the demand for optics remain strong. Our sales there remain strong. We're optimistic. But one of the thing -- and it's going to be strong for a long time. But one of the things that is proven to be a characteristic of the Web 2.0 market is that the revenues there are lumpy. They are unpredictable to some level by us. But they're also unpredictable in -- by some of the Web 2.0 companies themselves.
Well, I think economies of scale are a key differentiator in almost any market. And I think that's one of the advantages we have in optical communications, is that we have the largest volume of anybody in the industry. So I think that benefits us. I have said many times that I think of -- consolidation could benefit this industry. But it is so fragmented, particularly on the telecom side. But as we see in the Web 2.0 space, it's becoming more fragmented on the datacom side as well. So it's -- consolidation would be a long, long roll up of a lot of companies. So I think it'd be very -- I still think it's very difficult to do. And that's one of the reason we have had so little effective consolidation in the past.
Right now, we're matching prices. In some cases, we don't actually match the price, but we have to get close. And we haven't seen levels, or we haven't seen products get to the level where we've had to walk away.
Actually, 40G was probably a little better than expected. We had a really strong quarter in the 40G and datacom. And that was, I think a little bit due to, as I referred to earlier, the lumpiness in the Web 2.0 demand.
It was pretty steady through the whole quarter.
I would say there's a wave of activity on the part of the Web 2.0 companies that are moving toward that 25G I/O end switches. And that's going to be multiple, like, 4 -- and the 4x 25G or 100G ethernet is going to be an interconnect, that's going to be important in calendar year '16. Tell me again, Joseph, you asked some question earlier that sort of blew by me.
There will be some differences. There's some customers who will want 4x 25G in single mode versions and there will be other customers who want 4x 25G for multi-mode versions inside the data center and only transitioning to single mode as the links go across campuses or between data centers. And that is not uniform. The uniformity in the push by the Web 2.0 companies is that push toward the 25G I/O for the switches.
China is probably -- overall, it approaches 10% of our revenue. Maybe it's a little more than 10% of our revenue, I guess, now if I add up sort of the OEM stuff and all of that various, various big consumers over there. The -- but in general, I don't know, I think the China demand has been pretty good. We had a weak quarter in wireless. But we don't think the future is -- we think there's going to be -- the fourth-generation LTE expansion in China is still going on, we expect to sell a lot of transceivers there, and now, for I don't know, how many -- next couple of years, anyway.
We have 25G lasers. We have 25G photo detectors. We are -- I -- we have the building blocks to build those products. And right now -- and we have supplied early samples and the prototypes for companies to do their system test to a number of customers. So it's coming, and we're ready.
I don't know. I just heard that one of the big carriers who is targeting a 100G Coherent upgrade of their metro network next year has moved that -- the implementation date out by a quarter. So I don't know exactly what that means. It's maybe between them and the system vendors that are supplying them. It could -- often in these systems, the long tent pole is software and it could be the network management system at the service provider or it could be the similar software interface at the equipment provider. I just don't know, I would be speculating.
Well, we are interested in consolidation. And over the years, we have -- we've completed, I think, 21 acquisitions since we went public in 1999. So I'm sure we will do more acquisitions. But the criteria for each one of them is that it is a benefit to our shareholders. And it's a benefit because we can increase earnings per share. We can acquire technology that we can use to build products that will increase earnings per share. And it's a simple criteria. So we will continue to use that criteria as we approach opportunities for consolidation.
Well, calendar year '16, which is most of our fiscal year '17, is going to be the year of 25G I/O in the data centers. And so there will be a whole new series of switches, families of switches that will come from all of the networking equipment companies and the white box switch companies, a new -- servers with 25G I/O. So I mean, it's a whole series of new optical products where the base rate is 25 gigabits. And then we do multiples of 25G, was where we get to the 100G I/O in a single socket.
James, I think our revenues in 100G are still larger in CFP than they are CFP2. But I think our volumes may be larger in CFP2.
I think it's going to be meaningful this fiscal year, right? I think we're seeing increases in sales. We're shipping a lot of early production or early samples for qualification and testing to a number of customers, both OEMs and Web 2.0 companies. So I honestly -- I think it's -- our third and fourth quarters of this fiscal year, I think we're going to see meaningful revenue from the QSFP28 form factor.
Well, the opportunity is large. It is -- if I quote the RHK and Infonetics, some of the guys who track these markets, it's a $500 million market in 2016, '17, increasing to an $800 million a year market in '17, '18. And then the question is, what share of that market can we win? Well, we're still very optimistic that we have an excellent product that is going to garner a disproportionate market share. So we're optimistic about it.
We're working on lower-cost versions of all the products that we ship into the Web 2.0 space. We're-- and we'll have reduced cost in 10G, reduced cost in 40G and our new 100G products are coming out. The cost reduced versions of those will be out early. So I -- it's -- I would say most of these are about the targets about the first of the calendar year, or the end of this calendar year.
No, I haven't. I have seen -- Huawei has acquired small optics companies in Europe that had, not production capability, but technology. Nothing recently, but on the last couple of years, maybe. But I haven't seen anything out of China recently.
Well, we think it's an advantage to be vertically integrated. Now you've got to define vertical integration. I mean, for us, a typical transceiver has a laser that we make, a photo detector that we make, a number of ICs or a large integrated IC that we design and we go to foundry to have it fabricated. And then we do assembly and test, where we put together the printed circuit board with the optics, with the stampings and castings and connectors to connect it to the optical network. So vertical integration, that's really important to us are those lasers, photo detectors and ICs. The assembly and test is something that we do very efficiently because of our scale of operations. But we always weigh make versus buy there. Could -- can we have a contract manufacturer do it for us for less money than we can do it ourselves? In general, we find that, that analysis shows that we can do it more efficiently and less expensively ourselves. But we are sure open to that. It's -- I don't know -- that's just part of trying to run the most efficient business we can.
Well, we think of ourselves as a growth company. We think of ourselves as a company who is increasing market share. And we have done that very consistently for the last, I don't know, 8 years, we've increased market share every year. And our expectation and our goal is to continue with that. The industry analysts that track our industry, Light Counting, RHK and Phonetics, predict that this industry is going to grow at somewhere around 12% per year for the next 5 years. Now I will point out that the industry -- their estimates 5 years ago were a little optimistic. But nevertheless, our goal was that our revenue should grow that faster, faster. And we're investing in a lot of new products and a lot of new technologies to make sure that, that can happen.
Well, the succession plan is not one that we're likely have public discussions about. I will tell you that it's an important discussion at the Board level, and obviously, at our most recent Board meeting, which was yesterday and the day before, there were a lot of discussions about succession. So yes, there's -- there is planning. There is discussions and -- but nothing is -- there's no succession imminent. I have assured the Board that I'm around for the foreseeable future.
Well, we're optimistic about the wireless business. I expect that we'll see -- I don't know, I think our revenues will grow a bit in this quarter. But I think that for the next several quarters, I would expect that our wireless revenues will increase. Storage is actually an interesting space. We're seeing -- we've seen some strength in storage, particularly with respect to 16 gigabit Fibre Channel and whereas our revenues of 16 gigabit are climbing pretty rapidly to overtake 8 gigabit. So I think that's -- the storage market is one that people don't think of very often. But we at Finisar have a very large market share there. And I just happened to look the other day at a Light Counting report for the Fibre Channel market. And they do predict that it's -- that optics and Fiber Channel are going to grow at a 9% rate per year for the next 5 years. So it's not a stagnant market.
No, that's actually...
The thing that's nice about the storage market is that storage is about Fibre Channel and SANs. It's the company jewels. It's the Oracle database. The SAP database. It has to be rock-solid reliable. Companies that supply equipment into that space, like our reliability, like that we are the gold standard of the industry and that's an advantage for us. It's -- whereas it's a little -- it's a lot different than that in the Web 2.0 space.
Well, I think it's been a real asset for the company. Yesterday, I was at Cisco and was on stage receiving an award for Finisar for the last year as being the most flexible company, in terms of achieving unexpected deliveries of product when Cisco had upside demand. And the reason we can do that is we own our own factories. And we can respond quickly. We control our own priorities. Now to your -- to the extent that -- the other issue with the factories is we control our quality, we control our turnaround and responsiveness. We control our IP and if you -- if we went to a contract manufacturer, all of the equipment that we put in these factories, we would have to spend that same CapEx, short of just building the building. We'd have to spend that same CapEx to put equipment in the factories of our contract manufacturers. Because they operate basic pick and place equipment. But if you want specialized test racks, you want temperature testing, you want wavelength measurement, et cetera, you have to provide the equipment to them. So it's -- the CapEx burden is still pretty high.
Well, Kevin, I thank you very much for hosting us today. And I thank everyone who tuned in.

I am pleased to announce revenues for our second fiscal quarter were $321.1 million, up from $314 million in the prior quarter, a quarter-to-quarter increase of just over 2%. This increase was primarily from strong sales of 100-gigabit Ethernet transceivers, 10-gigabit tunable transceivers and wavelength selective switches. We also saw a resurgence in demand from China during the quarter.


Now I'll let Kurt review the rest of the numbers. Kurt?
Thanks, Kurt. We expect revenues for our third fiscal quarter to be in the range of $300 million to $320 million. We expect telecom revenues to grow again during the quarter, and we expect continued strong demand for 10-gigabit tunable transceivers and wavelength selective switches. We also expect demand from China to remain strong.


We are seeing continued demand for 100-gigabit Ethernet transceivers. However, we expect that growth to be more than offset by reduced revenue in 40-gigabit Ethernet transceivers. This is due to the lumpiness in demand at multiple large data centers. We also expect a decline in sales of Ethernet transceivers for wireless applications that we include in our datacom bucket. Overall, we expect datacom revenues in Q3 to decline a bit.


We expect third quarter non-GAAP gross margins to be approximately 30%, as the positive impact of favorable product mix is offset by the impact of 1 month of the annual telecom price reductions that typically take effect on January 1. Please note that our fiscal fourth quarter will include 3 months of these annual price reductions.


We expect operating expenses to be flat to down a little in Q3 in the range of $67.5 million to $68 million. Non-GAAP operating margins are expected to be approximately 7.5% to 8.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $0.19 to $0.25.


While we expect the remainder of fiscal 2016 to be a bit challenging, we are optimistic about fiscal 2017. We expect to benefit from the ramp of many new products and associated revenue growth, driven by both data center construction and upgrades and the increased deployment of ROADMs in 100-gig and 200-gig coherent transceivers in the telecom metro market.


We continue to believe that the long-term growth prospects of our company and the optical communications industry are positive. From our position as the industry leader, we will continue to develop the technology and the next generation of products for both the datacom and the telecom markets.


Finisar's revenue is driven primarily by growth in the global demand for bandwidth due to the increasing distribution and use of video, images and digital information. In addition, Finisar continues to benefit from the growth in cloud services, which drives network hardware upgrades of existing data centers and the build-out of new hyperscale data centers.
And now, with that, I'm going to turn it back over to Tom and open it up for questions. Tom?

Question and Answer
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Well, actually the demand in China comes from a number of customers and I think a number of end applications. Wireless is pretty strong in China. I think -- we don't participate in the PONs market, but they're spending a lot of money on PONs. The long-haul upgrade program for 100-gig coherent is well underway and is moving in a very positive direction. So I don't know. Overall, demand from China is pretty good. In addition, they're building a number of big data centers over there. And so equipment suppliers that supply equipment into these data centers as well as the data centers themselves are also pretty strong in demand.
Patrick, let me go back. You asked me a question and I didn't answer, and it just struck me. And that was about, are there going to be ROADMs in China? And the answer is, yes, I think so. We're seeing a ripple of ROADM sales in China and ROADM trials, et cetera, and some installations. So will it get started in a big way? I can't predict that yet, but this is very encouraging.
Well, that one's difficult for me to predict because I do not know how well Foxconn will operate the subsidiary. I think it's a little different than other things that they do in that they have to develop new products, develop new technology, go through qualification and field trials and all the things that you do in the optics business, and I think that's a bit different than what most of the things Foxconn's done in the past. So we'll see. I mean, it's all going to play out.
Well, demand for wavelength selective switches is strong. Most of the demand, as you might imagine, is for Flexgrid optical switches. And we see it from all over the world. So I'm not going to comment specifically on any particular customer, but I just think it's fair to say that it's an exciting time for us as we have -- as we see the volumes increase and we are -- lead times going out on wavelength selective switches.
Well, 100-gig includes a number of products. And the most -- the important ones today are the CFP form factor, the CFP2 form factor and the QSFP28. We are shipping everything we can, and we're not -- and the lead times are going out. So it's a very strong market right now. And it's strong in all 3 form factors. The QSFP28 is the one that I would say, on a percentage basis, we've seen the greatest increase in revenue. And I expect that, that will be the case over the next, oh, probably 1 to 2 years. I'm sure it's going to take off because that's the big product for the hyperscale data centers.
Well, we have -- there's a number of flavors in the QSFP28 family. And our total revenues were measured in millions of dollars, but not tens of millions of dollars. But we expect it to be up at a very steep rate over the next N number of quarters.
Oh, I would hate to be so cocky as to say I think price pressure is behind us. I think we have a very competitive industry. And I suspect we're always going to find that there is some price pressure. But my hope is in the next -- this next quarter and the quarter after that at least in the datacom market prices will be more stable, and we expect that.
Well, let's back up. First of all, with respect to the telecom price negotiations, it's about the same as it has been in the last 3 years. It's always -- we've always said it's usually normally between 10% and 15%. In the last 3 years, it's been closer to 15% than it was to 10%. It's the same this year. With respect -- I don't -- with respect to Verizon, I was merely -- in the last conference call -- reciting what I had been told by one of our customers, that they expected their big revenues to come in the second half of 2016 -- of calendar 2016. I suspect that is still the case. But I do know that equipment suppliers are starting to get orders for 2016 deliveries, but I'm sure it will ramp during the year.
Yes. Right, on a sequential basis.
Correct.
That's also correct.
Well, we will have products that have non-hermetic packaging included as part of our effort to produce the lowest-cost designs that we can for the application. And I assure you, our goal is to always be cost competitive so that we can be price competitive in each of the market segments that we serve. So we will have non-hermetic components in our devices.
Oh, the first ones are probably sampling to some customers now and generally available, I'd say, in our fourth quarter or maybe the first quarter of fiscal '17.
No, I'm sure it won't. We'll take them one at a time. And I'm sure the first products are likely to be 10-gig/40-gig products.
Well, my assumption is that the Tomahawk chipset from Broadcom is going to be generally available to all the switch builders in 2016. And they will have -- I mean, there have been a number of designs that have been announced that are around that. But in terms of production, I assume, my -- our belief is that 2016 is going to see a number of product introductions and production releases. So that implies that products with 25-gigabit I/O are going to be in much demand next year.
No Fibre Channel that I know off, all Ethernet, mostly 10-gig and a little 40-gig.
Well, most of the wavelengths that are currently in telecom transport systems are still 10 gigabits. And there are a few big phone companies worldwide that are adding 100-gig coherent and doing upgrades. But I will tell you, there's an awful lot of them that are still adding 10-gigabit wavelengths to fibers. And that's where they're going. We're selling them to equipment companies.
No, it's broad.
Our view is that revenues in this area have been below our expectations for some time and we now -- they're starting to fulfill our expectations. So we think we're going to sell tunable transceivers for quite some time.
No, it's quite global. Demand is strong from European customers, American -- U.S. customers as well as Asian. And I think it's mostly an increase in demand, is what I would say. I mean, I'd like to think that we're taking share, but I'm not sure, honestly. I just know that we're selling all we can build.
CFP4 is sure much smaller than the CFP and the CFP2.
That is totally dependent upon the growth in 100-gig. And if you listened, I don't know, 6 months ago to some of these big data center builders, I would have told you that it would have fallen off very rapidly as we move into 2016, at least in that sector. But, it turns out -- I suspect things don't always turn out exactly as predicted. So my guess is that the 40-gig continues as a pretty strong product into end of 2016 for some period, as we see the increase in sales of 100-gig in the QSFP28 form factor.
Well, we sell a lot of single mode as well. But we, as a company, have historically been strongest in VCSEL-based multimode devices. So I would expect that, that's where we would continue to be the strongest.
Well, it's pretty amazing because it wasn't that long ago that we developed this concept of Flexgrid. And that we could -- instead of fixed spacing of wavelengths, we could put them in super channels, and we could put them on flexible spacing and then work on the granularity and finer and finer granularity between wavelengths. And that allowed the phone companies to be able to use their coherent transmission links as spectrally efficient as they could possibly be. And it took a while. I mean, it literally took a year or more for some of the major phone companies to open their eyes and say, that's really valuable. But I will tell you, the Flexgrid is most of what we're selling today worldwide. Makes no difference whether it's U.S., Europe or Asia.
Well, Tom, thank you very much. And we are pleased that all of you tuned in today. We hope to see you again in 3 months at our third quarter conference call. So good day to all of you.","Thank you, Sarah, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your taking the time to listen to our conference call today.

I am pleased to announce revenues for our third fiscal quarter were $309.2 million. This was close to the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter which was $300 million to $320 million. Due to a favorable product mix, gross margins were a bit better than expected at 30.3%. In addition, we benefited from lower-than-expected expenses to produce $0.25 in earnings per fully diluted share, which was at the upper end of our guidance.


And now with that, I'll let Kurt review the rest of the numbers. Kurt?
Thanks, Kurt. We expect revenues for our fourth fiscal quarter to be in the range of $307 million to $327 million. We expect both datacom and telecom revenues to grow relative to the third quarter. We are seeing strong growth from China due to the continued long-haul and wireless buildouts at China Telecom, China Unicom and China Mobile as well as strength in North America from the expansion of next generation metro networks.


We also expect telecom revenue growth in Q4 from Europe and the Middle East. Datacom revenue growth during the quarter is expected to be primarily due to increased sales of 100-gigabit ethernet transceivers in CFP, CFP2, CFP4 and QSFP28 form factors.


Telecom revenue growth during the quarter is expected to be primarily due to continued strong demand for wavelength selective switches and ROADM line cards. In addition, we expect growth from our 100-gig and 200-gig line-side products such as CFP2 ACO. Given the strong demand for our 100-gig client-side modules as well as our wavelength selective switches, wavelength selective switch-based line cards and our CFP2 ACO products, we are capacity constrained on all of these products and we are actively adding capacity to meet customer demand.


We expect fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margins to be approximately 30% as the positive impact of favorable product mix is offset by the impact of 3 months of the annual telecom price reductions. We expect operating expenses to be relatively flat at approximately $67.5 million.


Non-GAAP operating margins are expected to be between 8.2% and 9.2%. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share are expected to be between $0.22 and $0.28 per share.


We continue to believe that the long-term growth prospects of our company in the optical communications industry are positive. In fiscal 2017, we expect to benefit from the increased sales of many new products, driven by both data center construction and upgrades and increased deployment of ROADMs and the 100-gig, 200-gig coherent transceivers in telecom long-haul and metro.


Finisar's revenue is primarily driven by growth in the global demand for bandwidth, from the increasing distribution and use of video, images and digital information.


In addition, Finisar continues to benefit from the growth in cloud services, which drives networking hardware upgrades of existing data centers and the construction of new hyperscale data centers.
And now with that, I'm going to turn it back over to Sarah and open it up for questions.

Question and Answer
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Well, we're shipping our QSFP28 in, I consider it to be, volumes because in previous quarters we shipped hundreds and now we're shipping thousands, so I think that's good progress. And we expect that the impact throughout this -- the rest of this calendar year is going to be, is -- well, let's see. The growth rate will be very impressive for us and probably the highest growth part of any of our product lines that we sell.
Well, our WSS business today in total is pretty close to 30% of our telecom revenues. And we expect it to grow. Demand is very strong there.
I don't -- from our standpoint, I couldn't point to a single market segment or a geography or a customer, a large customer, where I think it's had any impact all. So I'm -- obviously, when there's any change like that taking place, our hopes would be that it's beneficial to us. But I have no data to indicate that yet, so.
Well, it is a competitive business, and we have, in some segments of the business, seen competition from companies that we never had to compete with before. But that's life in the Web 2.0 space. It is: They control their environment; they control both ends of the network; they don't have to be interoperable with anybody but their own equipment; they don't have to sell these products to anybody else. You know the drill, it never gets too hot and it never gets too cold in those data centers. And it never rains in there, so they don't have to worry about Bellcore qualifications. So we haven't -- we are competing with companies that we have never competed against before in that Web 2.0 space. But overall, our business has held up really quite good in 10 gigabit. It's still -- I don't know, I would guess we -- it's still our largest product segment of them all. And we're not predicting strong growth in the future, but 10 gigabits in the enterprise is still the workhorse of data really.
It's not coming down at that same steep rate.
Yes.
First of all, we don't think the ZTE situation is going to have a meaningful impact on us. It's not a -- they have not been anywhere near our 10% customer in the past. My hope is that whatever these restrictions that finally come out from the government on shipments to ZTE, that they don't extend that to Huawei or to other companies in China. I have no reason to believe that they will but I'm -- it's -- anyway, I would hate to see that happen. Let's see. And will it benefit any of our business at Huawei? No, I doubt it. I mean maybe it benefits Huawei and if Huawei's volume is up because ZTE can't ship to some of the customers that they compete with Huawei for that might increase demand from Huawei. So I guess it's possible. It could benefit our relative volumes that we do with Huawei.
Well, one of the things that's a little hard for us to size is exactly what -- when we sell to China, we sell to OEMs, and about 20% of our revenue today goes to China. And how much of that stays in the country versus exported from China from those OEMs is -- and it varies some from each one of the OEMs to the other OEMs. I mean, some export more than others. So it's really hard to say exactly what stays in the country and what doesn't. Generally, one of the things that I think I would tell you though that's pretty exciting is that, heretofore, everything that we have shipped in wavelength selective switches to China have been exported. But now in the last quarter, we shipped wavelength selective switches to China that were actually used in end networks in China in a deployment. And so we think that as a wave of the future that is going to be very positive for that whole ROADM segment.
Well, we think our product position is great. We think we have a very competitive, high-performance wavelength selective switch. We invented this concept of flexible grid spacing of the wavelengths. And a number of the carriers, most of the major carriers in the Western world now all demand that. And we're being told that the Chinese carriers are demanding that. So that plays to our strength, and we expect that product line to be very strong for now for -- our expectations are it could be a real boom in that product line for a couple of years, maybe longer.
Well, we believe that we have a CFP2 module that will be very competitive at 100-gig but will be superior in performance to any of the offerings that we have seen in the market so far at 200-gig and 250-gig and for 16 quantum transmission. And -- so I'm -- that's -- I think will be -- obviously, we will be competitive at 100-gig but I think we're going to be tough to match at the higher data rates.
Well, first of all, Chinese New Year always has a seasonal impact because things just shut down over there for a week. But nevertheless, demand continues to be strong out of China. And the answer to the question about ""How long can the demand stay strong, or even increase?"" is all related to government spending, it's government stimulus, it's infrastructure spending. So our expectations, at least from what we are being told by the equipment companies anyway, is that they expect it for, I don't know, a couple of years at least. But even then, I think everybody is speculating it. All the policies of spending are determined really by the government, so [indiscernible].
We expect qualifications to be received this quarter. And we're building line cards right now for delivery.
Wow, I bet we're shipping more than 3 flavors.
We're not shipping PSM4 flavor. We're not shipping. Not yet. We're shipping LR4, we're shipping SR4 and we're shipping a few of short wavelength multiplex devices.
Yes. I think there's a few more competitors in the 100-gig cycle than there were in the 40-gig cycle.
Well, let's see. First of all, let me talk about QSFP28. It's a good product. Gross margins are above our company average. We expect it to be additive to our gross margins. And now will they be quite as high as what a 100-gig was back in the introduction of our first CFP 100-gig? Or back in the early days of 10 gig? Probably not quite. But like all new product cycles, it appears that pricing is still attractive there and it will be.
I can't predict that it would be any different, honestly. I mean, I don't -- I think we're -- actually, I think we are more competitive in the early stages of the 100-gig QSFP28 than we were in the early stages of the QSFP 40-gig. So I think that bodes well for us. But to predict market share, how it's going to shake out, I -- I don't -- I can't -- I don't have any data today that would say it would be any different.
We don't expect it to fall off a cliff, but we're not optimistic about strong growth in 40-gig any longer because of the strong -- really strong growth in 100-gig. So most of the 40-gig sales went into the Web 2.0 space and most of the 100-gig, QSFP28 anyway, is going to go into the Web 2.0 space. So I would say that they're still going to deploy 40 gig and there's still some of the Web 2.0 guys that are going to buy 40-gig for some period of time. But we just don't -- we just expected the conversion to 100-gig is going to take some of the impetus out of that and it will -- but our expectation honestly is it will decline at some rate but not off a cliff for sure.
Well, I think you hit a nail right on the head with VMI. Because the last time we had a big inventory correction was back in our Q3 of '11, our fiscal year '11. And our wavelength selective switches and our 40-gig transceivers and, all of a sudden, what had been enormous demand for a couple of years before that, all of a sudden stopped because of the inventory correction. Well, since then, most of -- I mean those products are now in vendor managed inventory hubs. So we ship to hubs, which kind of balance the inventory, we have some visibility as to what that inventory is. Now having said that, our customers do what businesses do when they're short in supply of key components. And that is they typically will double order, and they will hoard, and they will -- they try to protect their revenue stream. And I think it is a natural behavior on the part of all the equipment companies. And we try to gauge where the shipments need to be to support production as opposed to where inventory builds might be taking place. But I think it's inevitable that there would be some inventory buildup. Now with having said that, though, I still think it is, we'll see less of an impact from a correction than we have seen in the past just because of the inventory hubs that are in existence now.
I couldn't tell you for sure because they never will admit that they're double ordering. But I would suggest that to the extent that there are limited supplies in the industry, the supply chains of big equipment companies are trying to place orders any place they can. And so it's possible.
Wireless, we have not exited the business. We still sell opportunistically into the wireless business where we have capacity and where there is demand for capacity for buildouts. And that sometimes gets business at prices that we find attractive.
Right.
What's -- the other one you asked about was -- tell me again.
Web 2.0 demand has been a little slow. It's hard to say because it's never uniform across all of the Web 2.0 cloud services providers. But we have seen, in some cases, demand for 40 gig to be down a little bit in anticipation of deploying 100 gig. We also always see that forecasting in that space is always an iffy -- it's just an iffy subject because they're not very accurate. And I suspect it's because of the construction project nature of their business that construction projects have holes and they have delays and they have other things that go on. And that delays the sequence of all the materials that get delivered to a job site. So I don't -- I think the demand -- everything we know about the demand for Web 2.0, overall, it remains strong and I think for the next year, it's going to be strong. It's just quarter-to-quarter, you see variations.
CFP2 coherent is a rapidly growing market, and it's going to be huge for optics. And it's going to be huge for optics for the next several years as all the telecom companies worldwide, as they upgrade their networks they're putting in ROADM capabilities and they're putting in the 100-gig into coherent. And it's the combination of the two that makes these networks so capable. So now to talk about how any one company that's entered -- that has not yet entered the market but has announced product but they haven't built it yet is hard to predict because those products aren't yet available to customers. And aren't -- at least we're not running into them. So I'm -- I hear the announcements, I read the announcements. I anticipate that there are going to be new entrants that will have real products in the market. I suspect when we go to OFC this year, we're going to see some first off samples that will be demonstrated there by one or more companies. But I'm not going to predict yet that we're -- we won't be very competitive with those. And our solution is an internal laser and an internal modulator.
We'll have our first revenues this quarter off of the pilot line. We'll have -- and as we -- over the next few quarters after that, we will start moving -- we'll be moving that product into one of our Asian plants for volume ramp.

I am pleased to announce that revenues for our fourth fiscal quarter were $318.8 million, an increase of $9.6 million or 3.1% over the third quarter. This growth was primarily from increased demand for 40 gigabit per second and 100 gigabit per second datacom transceivers. Gross margin was 30.6%. Combined with lower expenses, this resulted in non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share of $0.29, which was $0.01 above the upper end of our guidance range.


And now I'll let Kurt review the rest of the numbers. Kurt?
Thanks, Kurt. For our first fiscal quarter of FY '17, we expect revenues to be in the range of $323 million to $343 million. We expect both datacom and telecom revenues to be greater than the fourth quarter. We continue to see strong demand from China due to the long-haul and wireless build-outs at all the major carriers. North America demand remains strong due to the expansion of next-generation metro networks. Europe and Middle East demand is also strong.


We expect datacom revenue growth during the first quarter will be primarily from increased sales of 100 gigabit Ethernet transceivers. Telecom revenue growth in the first quarter is expected to be primarily from continued strong demand for our wavelength selective switches, 10 gigabit tunable transceivers and our ROADM line cards. In addition, revenues for 100 gigabit and 200 gigabit line-side products, such as CFP2 ACO, are expected to increase. We are experiencing such strong demand for our broad range of our product lines that we have many capacity constraints. We are actively adding capacity to try to meet our customers' demands.


We expect non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter of FY '17 to be approximately 31%. We expect operating expenses to increase to approximately $68.5 million, mostly due to higher legal expenses from a patent trial where we are the plaintiff. We also expect an increase in payroll taxes from the annual vesting of employee RSU grants, which occurs every June. In addition, sales and marketing expenses are expected to be higher due to the expected growth in revenue.


Non-GAAP operating margins are expected to be between 9.9% and 10.9%, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $0.27 to $0.33 per share.


Overall demand is strong from a broad range of customers, and we expect demand to remain strong for quite some time. We continue to believe in the long-term growth prospects of our company in the optical communications industry, and we think they're positive. In our fiscal 2017, we expect to benefit from the ramp of many new products. Revenue growth will be driven by both data center construction and upgrades as well as increased deployment of ROADMs and 100-gigabit and 200-gigabit coherent transceivers in telecom networks.


Finisar's revenue is driven primarily by growth in the global demand for bandwidth due to the increasing distribution and use of video, images and digital information. In addition, we continue to benefit from the growth in cloud services, which drives network hardware upgrades of existing data centers and the construction of new hyperscale data centers.
And now with that, I'm going to turn it back over to Rachel and open it up for questions. Rachel?

Question and Answer
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Let's see. Verizon, we don't -- we're not qualifying directly with Verizon. We qualify with equipment companies who supply to Verizon. And qualification is in progress. A lot of tests have been run. A lot of success has been achieved. But there's a lot of details that relate to firmware or software, all kinds of things. And it's like we expect full qualification at any time, and it could happen in weeks or it could be longer. But we expect it's making good progress, and we expect it to be completed shortly. ROADM capacity is -- for us, it's the wavelength selective switch capacity. It's a reasonably complicated subject in that we do most of the work in China in our Wuxi factory. So we have to add equipment and people and training there, and it takes a fair amount of training for this. And we also end up -- we do some of the work on many of the wavelength selective switch products back in our Sydney, Australia facility. So anyway, we -- it's a little more complicated subject than just saying, ""Oh, we didn't get all the equipment in and running because you not only have to have the equipment. You got to have operators hired, and you got to have operators trained."" And so somewhere between all of that, we didn't quite get the capacity up in the line that we thought we were, but we feel free -- we feel sure we're going to have it online this next quarter, and we're predicting that our revenues for wavelength selective switches will be up nicely.
Well, we don't have any market share with Verizon. So our market share can only go up.
I don't really have a breakout, I can say, between single-mode intra-data center and single mode that goes inter-data center. The 40G decline is one of those things where we've expected the decline in 40G revenues prior to this time but are surprised of its strength. But that -- maybe that's not surprising since there have been a lot of switches deployed with 40 gigabit sockets in them for, what, the last 2, 3 years. And some of those sockets aren't built yet. And so there is still an ongoing market of -- as you expand capacity in existing 40G data centers, filling those sockets with 40G transceivers. So I'm not the guy that's going to -- because I predicted that it would have declined already but -- so I was wrong, and I'm not going to predict again when it's going to decline.
About 20%.
I don't know that I'm ready to predict magnitude. I will tell you that we shipped about 100 units last quarter. Some of those actually ended up in end-customer installations. So they're actually in the field, but they were part of systems that our customers, the equipment companies, wanted to ship with some urgency because we have not completed our full qualification -- all the qualification tests that go into the CFP2 ACO. So we're close but we've got a few things that are still in the oven, as they say and -- but all that stuff, I expect to be cleared up soon, and we expect that we're going to ship several times in the first quarter what we shipped in the first quarter -- in the fourth quarter.
That's correct. Our ultimate production of this product is going to be in Wuxi, China.
In general or for this product?
I think so. You're talking of expectation?
In prior quarter, we had 2.
We have no information about that. So I only know what I read on the web because I don't read much. It's not covered in the local papers.
Well, Huawei is a big customer for this entire industry. And if they got into hot water with the U.S. government and the same problem that happened with ZTE happened with Huawei, I mean it would be a problem for a lot of companies in the optics industry. I have no reason to expect that that's the case. I only know the rumors that you've heard. Our view of demand from China both for domestic use and for their export of systems is that demand remains strong. So...
I think it's too early to tell what my -- what our hopes are that with the shortages in the industry, supply will be more of an issue than price. Now we'll wait and see how that shakes out. With respect to the CapEx and capacity, I'll let Kurt address that one.
Let's see. It's got to be a good year for our fiscal '17 and for calendar year '17. For the rest of '16 and '17, I think it would be a very good year in data centers. As you pointed out, it's now the roll-out of 25-gigabit lanes and then, end times, 25 gigabit in transceivers. So I can tell you we're sold out on all those versions of 25-gigabit lane products, and the orders keep coming. So it's going to be a good year. Cavium and QLogic, I don't know how to read that one. Cavium is an IC company. They make switch chips. I don't know what else is in their product line because I'm not that familiar with the company. QLogic is, obviously, the -- one of the HBA players in the fiber channel industry, and they're good at it. So I don't expect there to be much change in the -- at least in the fiber channel side of QLogic's business. I mean, there may be some. One of the things that QLogic has been investing in for some time has been Ethernet NIC cards. And so maybe the Cavium -- being part of Cavium would benefit their Ethernet NIC card business.
None yet, and I don't -- right now, the biggest concerns we have is all about capacity. It's about we've got more orders than we can ship. So...
Well, the baseline is right. And exactly where we're going to end up the calendar year is not clear, but it will be higher than the baseline. So we're -- I mean, we are expecting growth in that business. We have very strong demand in the wavelength selective switch product lines, and we're adding capacity.
Let's see. Getting back to the high end of our range is a long-term goal, but I don't -- it's unlikely that we're going to get back to 35% in the -- anywhere in the near future. I guess that could change, but that's not what I expect right now. But it's nice that our gross margins were better this quarter. It's nice that they're going to be even better next quarter. I think that's a very positive trend. The whole thing about -- there are -- there is increased competition particularly in the Web 2.0 space, but the demand is so strong that there isn't enough productive capacity. A lot of the demand, a lot -- excuse me, a lot of the competition comes from smaller companies who don't have a lot of production capacity, who are forward pricing in order to gain market share. And then they got the challenge of, can they deliver? So how does -- how the equilibrium is going to be reached probably isn't clear yet. I just know that we run the biggest factories in the optics in the world. We have -- we are a dependable supplier, and all of these equipment companies and all of these Web 2.0 companies know they can count on us that we can produce the parts. So -- and the orders keep flowing. So...
We don't give any guidance beyond our next quarter. And is that -- I mean, is it possible? Sure, it's possible, but we're not necessarily predicting today.
And your question...
Excuse me, WSS?
Okay. Our WSS sales or worldwide -- and it is true that demand from China has been strong, but it's also true that demand from North America and even Europe is a bit strong. So I am -- we expect that there will be a -- our business is strong. And remember, we're not qualified in the line cards. We're trying to get qualified in for Verizon yet. So if -- when that happens, that's going to be an extra spurt in this WSS business. So I think -- I'm very optimistic about our wavelength selective switch business and the outlook there for quite some time.
Not clear. Whether we have capacity available or incremental business depends on how the rest of the world demand for wavelength selective switches goes. And the world's demand for ROADMs right now is pretty strong. I mean, in any developed country of the world, whether -- whatever continent they're on, if they're building a new telephone network or adding to an existing one, it includes ROADMs and it typically includes 100G coherent transmission. So I'm -- I guess, maybe my answer is, I sure hope we have the capacity but I'm -- to serve all of our customers, but I'm not certain. It depends on the growth and demand.
I'm not aware of any constraints there for us. We're quite vertically integrated on our QSFP28 product.
It's hard to tell in the short run what our share is and how it's shifting. I mean, we sort of see the data from the analysts like LightCounting that comes out sort of 6 months, Light -- that says, ""Here's how it was the last half of last year."" So I'm not sure whether we're really gaining share or not. But I will tell you that the 100G deployment in the world is strong, 100G coherent business in the world is strong, and the 100G CFP usually goes on the client side of those routers that have 100G output. So there's a lot of 100G everywhere. So it's -- and did we gain share on a worldwide basis during that period? Honestly, I would be speculating. And I can -- for sure, I can point to a couple of customers where I think we gain share but...
For the growth here, it would more than double.
We have some pretty big orders that we're trying to fill, but we have very big forecast from lots of customers about what their needs are going to be. And we have a lot of incoming phone calls about people concerned about their deliveries. So they're anxious. So we're building capacity. We're building more parts. And our expectations for growth in the QSFP28 product line is we're very optimistic there.
I don't know. I think there's a lot of -- there's been a lot of speculation and a lot of talk that was either overly ambitious by somebody. But generally, I think as I mentioned earlier, the advantage that we have is big capacity and the ability to supply and the ability to increase our capacity to ramp production. And I -- and it's not -- we don't generally have the lowest prices in the industry, and I doubt that we ever will have. We like to think that we make the best products in the industry, and we're the most reliable supplier. So I think for a long time, the demand is going to be stronger than the world's capacity for these products, and some of the components that go in these products are going to be in short supply as well. So we feel like we're in pretty good shape since we make all the lasers that go in our QSFP28s with the integrated circuits, and they're of our design and from our foundry runs. So we're -- I think we're in good shape.
Thank you, Rachel, and thank you, everyone, for tuning in to our fourth quarter conference call today. We hope you'll be able to join us again in 3 months. Have a good day.","Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your taking the time to listen to our conference call today.

I need to remind all of you that any forward-looking statements in today's discussion are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are discussed at length in our annual and quarterly SEC filings. Actual events and results can differ materially from any forward-looking statements. In addition, the company undertakes no obligations to update any forward-looking information that is presented.


Unless otherwise indicated, all results discussed are on a non-GAAP basis. A complete reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results may be found in our earnings press release and in the Investor Relations section of our website.


We have prepared some slides for today's earnings call. You can view them by connecting to the Investor Relations page on our website at finisar.com, click on Investors then scroll down to Webcast Archives and click. You'll see a listing for today's first quarter 2017 earnings call.


I am pleased to announce that Finisar achieved a new company record for revenues on our first quarter. Our sales were $341.3 million, an increase of $22.5 million or 7.1% over the prior quarter. This growth was primarily driven by strong demand for 100-gigabit per second transceivers in the CFP, CFP2, CFP4 and QSFP28 form factors. In addition, demand for wavelength selective switches remains strong.


Our non-GAAP gross margins improved significantly to 33.1%. This increase was primarily due to a favorable product mix and the  leverage we achieved with larger volumes in our vertically-integrated manufacturing infrastructure. The combination of higher revenues and better-than-expected gross margins resulted in non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share of $0.38, up 31% over our fourth quarter EPS and up 65% over our first quarter a year ago.


Now I'll let Kurt review the rest of the numbers.
Thanks, Kurt.


We expect revenues for our second fiscal quarter of 2017 to be in the range of $355 million to $375 million. We expect both datacom and telecom revenues to grow quarter-to-quarter.


We continue to see strong worldwide demand for telecom optical components due to the new long-haul metro and wireless deployments by many major carriers. Demand from North America and China remain particularly strong from the metro build-outs in North America and both long haul and metro deployments in China.


In the second quarter, we expect revenue growth for our datacom products, primarily from increased sales of 100-gigabit Ethernet transceivers. Strong demand for wavelength selective switches and the ROADM line cards will contribute to our Q2 telecom revenue growth. In addition, we expect increased line-side revenues for 100-gigabit per second and 200-gigabit per second coherent CFP2 ACO transceivers.


We are still sold out for a number of products and continue to add capacity to meet the strong demand. Some of our capacity expansion investments include 100-gig client-side transceivers, QSFP28, wavelength selective switches, line cards, 25-gigabit lasers and our 100-gigabit and 200-gigabit coherent CFP2 ACO transceivers.


We expect second quarter non-GAAP gross margins to improve again to approximately 34%. We expect operating expenses to increase to approximately $71 million in the second quarter. This increase is primarily from our annual salary merit increases that occurred on August 1, plus higher sales in marketing expenses related to increased revenue, but partially offset by lower legal expenses. Non-GAAP operating margins are expected to improve again to between 14.3% and 15.3%. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share are expected to be up again to between $0.44 a share and $0.50 a share.


We continue to believe that the long-term growth prospects for our company in the optical communications industry are positive. In fiscal 2017, we expect the benefit from the ramp of many new products. Revenue growth will be driven by both data center construction, 100-gigabit upgrades and the increased deployment of ROADMs and 100-gigabit per second, 200-gigabit per second coherent transceivers in telecom, long haul and metro markets. It truly is a great time to be in the optical communication business.


Finisar's revenue was primarily driven by growth in the global demand for bandwidth due to the increasing distribution and use of video, images and digital information. In addition, Finisar benefits from the growth in cloud services, which drives network and hardware upgrades of existing data centers and the construction of new hyperscale data centers.


And with that, I'm going to turn it back over to Tom and open it up for questions.
Tom?

Question and Answer
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................
It's a strong area. You asked about competition. There are a number of people that make products in that area, but we have a great product. I mean, it works well. We can build a lot of them. We sold most of them, I would guess. And that's not even fair. I was going to say we sold most of them in Web 2.0. I guess majority went to the Web 2.0 segment, but there was a lot of them that went to the Enterprise segment as well. So it's a great product, and there's more demand right now than we can supply, and I'm sure the whole industry can supply.
We are currently qualified with 2 OEMs who are shipping our product to their customers, and they use 2 different DSPs. We are in qualification with, I think, every other DSP that exist at some OEM. So we're making progress against that arsenal of DSPs that we have to inter-operate with. And we're making progress with the OEMs, but it's obviously slower than we had hoped.
Both. Actually that's not true. The places we're qualified right now, they are COTS DSP. We're in qualification with in-house DSPs, but I don't think we're fully qualified at any place that has an in-house DSP.
I think you're right. I mean, that's the way we view it, is that 100-gig rollout, the 25-gig lens and the Web 2.0 space has been -- the demand was really strong. Don't get me wrong. And -- but on the other hand, the difficulties they're having with a number of components, maybe that contributes to the reason that our 40-gig business remains as strong as it is. 10 gigabit is still strong mostly in Enterprise data centers.
I think it's interesting. I think if they accomplish what they were targeting, I mean, somebody deserves a Nobel Prize. It's difficult. Smart people have been working on this for 20 or 25 years. And if they can make a breakthrough, it's huge.
Well, I think it'll impact the industry. I mean in theory, it will impact -- it will have an effect on their economics of building things if they can build everything plainer. I think that's really positive, but I don't -- it's not positive for us. It's really positive for them. I think it'd be a great technology to have if you can do it, but I'll just assure you that there is a lot of skepticism in the industry right now about whether it really can be done.
Most of what we're selling today, probably the biggest volume is LR4 followed by CWDM followed by SR4.
Well, I'm sure you can predict our expectations in an industry where there are shortages everywhere. I would sure hope that our competitors aren't going to think that they have to buy market share by lowering their prices when they can't deliver the products that are on order today. So I hope that, that means that we have some price -- more price stability in the industry.
One thing I would interject with Web 2.0 is that is -- my view is it will end up 15% to 20% of our total revenue. I mean that's where we were -- and that's where we've been. But I do -- one of the things that I think you have to keep in mind, or I would remind you, is that we have -- we are the #1 company in the Web 2.0 space. You can name every one of these big cloud service providers and all the optics demand they have, we supply way more than anybody else in the industry.
Well, operator -- the service providers in China are, today, benefiting from infrastructure spending by the government, and they are upgrading their networks to 100 gigabits. We're not deploying ROADMs yet. The automation of optical networks using ROADMs has just not arrived in China. But they have run field trials, and they are running field trials in the second half of this year. And deployments are, I was going to use the word promised, but deployments are predicted in a big way in calendar year '17. So that is the new day for us, is the day that ROADMs start getting used in the bone systems or phone networks in China. Now we benefit a lot from 100-gigabit deployment in China. A lot of our competitors benefit from all the components that they supply: the lasers, the receivers, modulators, all the components that get slaughtered on the -- onto line cards by the big OEMs over there. It's a big market today, and it's big because of Chinese upgrades. But it's also big because the world's telephone networks are all -- when they do upgrades, anywhere in the world, they upgrade to 100 gigabit. I mean, that's just sort of a standard of today's upgrade. And so a lot of what the Chinese OEMs sell is for export to a lot of Third World countries in particular as well as some of the European countries.
Let's see. First of all, you're incorrect. We sell a lot of dual rate CFPs, CFP2s. We sell a lot more than 10 gigabits in China, but I think the biggest opportunity in China in the future is the deployment of ROADMs.
Well, I think it's going to stick around. A lot of 10 gig is going to be used in wireless, in the wireless fronthaul and wireless backhaul as well. So there's -- I don't know. I don't anticipate the 10-gig demand is going to drop off substantially in China.
I think the latter is what you -- is our strategy. What we're -- we're investing in products that we think we know have better-than-average gross margins for us and where the demand is strong, and we're here selectively not investing in some other segments which have -- which are less profitable. So I think that any businessman would make the same decision.
I don't know I could say we're making a bigger investment in the competition. I mean, 100-gigabit everything is pot, and so we're all expanding capacity in any 100-gigabit flavor that we sell. We're not investing as much in 10 gigabits, but I won't tell you that there are no specific segments of 10 gigabit we're investing in. Wavelength selective switches, we're investing a lot there. But I don't know that, that's -- that we're investing more than our competitors. Our competitors have stepped up their capital spending a fair amount over the last few quarters, and so I don't know how we are currently differentiating about where we're investing relative to everyone else because I don't know exactly where everyone else is investing. I just know they're spending more money.
We have increases in particularly in China and in North America. And we have some telecom OEMs that are in Europe, not many but a few. And the rest of the world has got -- it's pretty sparse.
Well, it vary. We have a big project where we're trying to qualify line card that'll end up in Verizon Metro system, and we are not yet qualified. We're in what is known as system verification tests, and we're not -- we haven't squeezed through that hole in the wall yet. We're making progress. But every time you run into a bit error from some rare condition, I mean, believe me, the systems guys drag up some rare conditions under which your device has to operate or turn the power off and on a thousand times in a second. And you can't take any bit errors really -- drop it on the floor and can't take any bit errors or whatever the torture that they want to apply to it. But we're working our way through it. We're making progress. The changes have not been hard where they have been, just changing software and firmware and tuning. So I believe we're closing in, but we're clearly late. Our expectations were that we were going to be fully qualified some number of quarters ago, and we're not yet. But I'm still optimistic, and it's coming. In calendar year '17, we're going to have substantial revenue coming.
Right.
Wuxi has been a wonderful story for us. We have about 5,000 people there. We -- if you recall, we now have the 600,000 square-foot manufacturing building, actually 2 300,000 square-foot buildings side by side. But we make telecom products. We make datacom products. We make a lot of 100-gig products. We typically make more difficult products, a lot of telecom is get -- does get made there because we have really good engineering support. And a lot of these complicated wavelength division, multiplexed TOSs, tunable TOSs, all these assemblies are really quite difficult and really quite complex. And so the assembly of those things and the tuning of all that is one of the specialties that Wuxi has. In addition, they build all the optical assemblies for our wavelength selective switches. So anyway, we're really proud of Wuxi and what they've accomplished. And they are -- any time we move a product to Wuxi from some remote location where we're doing some work, they make a heck of an impact in terms of the cost reduction on those items.
100 gig is clearly a competitive marketplace, and competitive -- there are competitive products in virtually everything that we make. But we make really good products, and they perform at a very high level. And we run the biggest optical factories in the world, and so we have economics of scale. And as Kurt pointed out earlier, as our volumes increase, we have leverage. And so we're in a great position with respect to costs of 100-gig products. And when there's a shortage in the world, our prices don't decline -- normally don't decline as fast as the customers would like them to. I mean, every customer wants prices to go down really, really fast. But I will tell you that in order to assure their revenue streams, in many cases, they just have to have a steady supply from guys like us. And so supply becomes more important than price in many cases.
Well, it depends on what meaningful revenue is. I mean, $1 million or $2 million a quarter, not so meaningful to us. But our expectations, all these qualifications that we're in will all yield a revenue stream that's going to be quite a few millions of dollars per quarter. So I'm -- I will not predict again which quarter we're going to get qualified at some of these major OEMs, but I will -- but I'm certain it's coming. And I think calendar year '17, we're going to see meaningful revenue, I mean, tens of millions of dollars from our CFP2 ACO.
Well, we make line cards today in Wuxi, China. We have major OEMs who buy line cards from us that are -- that include wavelength selective switches and erbium-doped fiber amplifiers and channel monitors and software and all that stuff. I mean, they're big, complicated line cards, and they're expensive. So we make them. We make them every quarter. That business is actually doing quite well right now with other customers. But these are systems around -- they go into systems around the world. But to my knowledge, none of them are going in the Verizon systems right now. So the one we're all focused on is trying to qualify a line card that will go into a ROADM rack with Verizon and be -- so that we can participate in their 100-gig Metro upgrade. But for us, it will be built in Wuxi. We have a whole infrastructure up there that can build these. We have actually built dozens of these Verizon line cards already. So we've got processes, we've got people, jigs, fixtures. We know how to do it. It's not capital-intensive in that the capital goes into building the Wavelength Selective Switch. That's where -- that's the most capital-intensive part of it. But the line card itself is -- it's sheet metal, it's a circuit board and a channel monitor and a Wavelength Selective Switch. You put them all together and button it up and you got -- and then you have to terminate a lot of fibers. There's a fair amount of labor that goes into building line cards because of the fiber routing and the fiber termination. But we're in pretty good shape where it comes to line cards.
Well, it's clearly different than what we had thought. It's slower than we have expected because we haven't qualified in most of the OEMs where we're in our qualification testing right now. We shipped about 100 units in the quarter. And I -- the real issue is you got to get through all these qualifications, and you got to get on the ADL. And we're -- I think we're within shouting distance of completing a number of them. We've completed 2, so far. But I'm not -- it's just taking longer than anybody predicted. It's just -- we're going to get there. We've got to -- we get some customers who come back and pat us on the back and tell us how great our product is and blah, blah, blah. But that's great. But we need to be on an ADL, and we need purchased orders. So I do expect that after -- by the end of our fiscal year, I think we're going to be shipping meaningful quantities. I do believe we will be qualified at some of the bigger OEMs, and so we're still diligently working on these knits and gnats of this qualification program.
Well, Tom, thank you very much. And everybody, we appreciate you tuning in to our second quarter conference call -- I mean, excuse me, our first quarter conference call today.

I am pleased to announce that Finisar achieved all-time quarterly record for revenues and profits in our second quarter. We had a very good quarter. Revenues were $369.9 million, an increase of $28.5 million or 8.4% over the first quarter. This growth was primarily driven by strong demand for 100-gigabit per second transceivers. In addition, customer demand was also strong for wavelength selective switches and ROADM line cards.


Our gross margins improved significantly to 37.2% due to a favorable product mix and the leverage we achieved from our vertical integration with larger production volumes. The combination of revenues being at the higher end of our guidance range, plus higher gross margins, resulted in earnings per fully diluted share of $0.58, which is well above our Q2 guidance range.


And now with that, I'll let Kurt review the rest of the numbers. Kurt?
Thanks, Kurt. We continue to believe that the long-term growth prospects of our company and the optical communications industry are positive. Current worldwide demand for optical products is strong and we expected to remain strong for a long time.


Our upcoming third quarter should be another record quarter for Finisar. We anticipate that revenues will be in the range of $378 million to $398 million, primarily from increased sales of 100-gigabit per second transceivers. We expect third quarter non-GAAP gross margins to improve again to approximately 37% to 38%. This increase will primarily come from a favorable product mix, plus the operating leverage from our vertical integration. One partial offset will be the impact of 1 month of the annual telecom price reductions that are typically effective January 1.


We expect operating expenses will be at approximately $72 million in Q3 or about 18.6% of revenue. Non-GAAP operating margin should continue to improve to approximately 18.5% to 19.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $0.58 to $0.64 per share. This would be another new quarterly record for Finisar, driven by our growing revenue and improving margins.


We continue to add capacity for a number of products. For QSFP28, in particular, we plan to increase capacity significantly in the third quarter and have plans to continue to increase capacity in the subsequent quarters. We are also adding capacity for the 100-gig and 200-gig coherent CFP2 ACO transceivers and the ROADM line cards for telecom and long haul and metro. We expect the qualification of these products by key customers in the next few months. In addition, we are also adding capacity for our wavelength selective switches. We believe that China will begin significant domestic deployments of ROADMs in calendar 2017.


Finally, we are adding capacity over the next couple of quarters in our VCSEL laser fab in Allen, Texas. This will enable us to produce -- pursue several new consumer applications for 3D sensing. Overall, we had an excellent second quarter and are expecting another one in Q3. I would like to thank all our loyal customers for their continued support, and I would like to thank all of our 14,000 employees for their hard work, creativity and attention to detail. I hope all of you listening to this call understands that our success is not a short-term effort. It comes from years of investment in R&D, people and facilities. But for all of us, it's a great time to be in optics.
And with that, I'm going to turn it back over to Angela and open it up for questions.

Question and Answer
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................
We have orders in hand as well.
We will ship wavelength selective switches into China in the next quarter. We also did last quarter.
Well, the project could be huge, there's a lot of debate about when exactly it's going to kick off with big orders and deployment is really going to begin in earnest. But the consensus from everybody is that it will be in calendar 2017. So does that mean -- my guess is it's not going to be big deployments in the first quarter. But any time after that, I would not be expecting -- I would not be surprised.
Generally, the price negotiations this year were more favorable for us than they have been in the last several years. So while we have always said that price declines that we see at January 1 every year usually range in the 10% to 15% range. This year, they're around 10%.
We believe we are. There's always some uncertainty about where all the products are going to end up. We know some of them have ended up in China. And we think some of the once that we're shipping today are going into the early deployment or trials as we refer to them.
Well, we don't talk about specific customers or specific products or situations with particular products. All I can tell you is that we believe that we will achieve qualifications at the key industry OEMs very shortly. Now is shortly weeks or is that months? I can't tell you because there's a lot of stuff that goes into having your qual and your listing on the ABL bottomed up, but I think we're very close.
Well, it's possible that some of these projects could turn into revenue in 2017 and particularly in the second half of 2017. But I think there's a lot of uncertainty that goes within any of them in terms of consumer products and which ones they'll introduce and what features and whatnot. Anyway, I think the numbers are incredibly exciting. But I think it's -- and we think it's a good enough bet that we're spending a lot of money on facility expansion, we're spending money to hire people, we're ramping production -- or production capability. And we think that there are a number of places where this 3D sensing is going to be an exciting consumer application.
No.
Well, we've achieved a number of customer qualifications. And we're still working on a few more. So we think we are very close to achieving all of the customer qualifications where we're currently engaged.
That's a tough one. It depends on the application. I think there are likely to be some that are going to be above the company average. I think it's possible. There may be some that are slightly below. I don't know what the average margin for that product line is going to be. I'll just tell you that we think it's going to be accretive, very nicely profitable and potentially there's a lot of leverage because it comes from a fixed cost facility, a big fab.
We're hundreds of units, not thousand.
Let's see. The answer to the first question is, I'm hard-pressed to think of a product line where we're not sold out. We're still adding, obviously, a lot of equipment and people in that Wuxi facility. And yes, we are probably going to add -- not probably, we're going to add a third building, which will increase capacity there by 50%.
Well, the LR4 is still our largest product line in that in the QSFP28. The CWDM4 is next. They're both growing very fast. And I don't know, they're competitive products, there's other people that can make them. But we think we have very good products, and we think our cost structure of making them is extremely competitive in this industry.
3D sensing is something that we've been working on for years, and we've had a number of smaller customers and it really hasn't moved the needle much in terms of revenue. But over the last, I don't know year, maybe 18 months, discussions in a number of consumer-based industries have really heated up. And as a result, we think that there's likely to be significant revenue and upside for us next calendar year for sure. Now -- and the reason we talked about it in this conference call is because all of a sudden, we're spending a lot of money on it. And so Kurt thought we ought to -- we're going to spend a lot of CapEx, we probably ought to tell people why we're spending a lot of CapEx.
Well, I don't view it as positive for us. Long term, Broadcom has said that they're going to be a component supplier and arms dealers for the optics industry. Maybe that's no real long-term impact. But I think short term, as long as they are the sales arm for Foxconn, I think it's likely they have some negative impact on us. But I will tell you that any big equipment company wants 2 sources for everything. And historically, in the SAN industry, Finisar has been the largest supplier in the industry, but Avago was right behind us. So I don't -- I'd still think we're going to have substantial sales, and I think really, really good relationships with not only Brocade, but Emulex as well.
Yes, we're positioned very well because we have with -- we're the biggest supplier in the datacom industry. Most of the server connections, server to server are copper. Some of the server to top-of-rack switch are optics, but most are still copper. And this is the 25, a 10-gig links and a 25-gig links. The switches from the top-of-racks switch to the aggregation switches are virtually -- or I won't say all, I could be wrong somewhere, but they are predominantly optical. And the rest of the connection in the data center are optical. As we -- the question is going to be, as Tomahawk goes to third-generation Tomahawk and the links become 50-gig PAM4, not 25-gig, the question is are -- will the connections within the server still -- can they still be a copper at those speeds? And the answer is, I don't know. The distances get shorter and shorter. And I think optics, the optics share of that business for sure will grow, but I -- it's hard for me to predict the complete demise of copper in some connections. In some cases, they're only a foot or two long.
Well, I don't think it's clear exactly what we'll be dominant for Chinese domestic deployment. I think that there will be applications that we broadcast in select and there will others that will be route and select. And I don't -- can't tell you exactly which of the carriers might select which one or if there will be a unified approach dictated by the government. There's always a bit of uncertainty that goes with sort of a mysterious operations of the Chinese government and the big Chinese national corporations. So I don't know, I think you might end up with some of both. And I think that for us, well, we make a lot of 1x9s and we make 1x9s' Flexgrid on the finest grid spacing that money can buy. And we make 2x1x20s for the route-and-select architectures. And they are, again, flexible-grid spacing, and I think we'll have a substantial business either way and in both cases.
Well, the only seasonality that I predict in China is Chinese New Year. And everything sort of slows down and stops before Chinese New Year, and it always seems like it takes a while for things to crank back up after Chinese New Year. So other than that, I don't have -- there's no seasonal pattern that I would predict. It all has to do with when the RFIs and RFQs come out and when do the deployments get started. But it will be after Chinese New Year, I'm pretty certain.
Both.
Broad based. There's not enough capacity in the industry to supply QSFP28s. There's not enough lasers available, there's just not enough capacity. So because we have big factories, we make our own lasers. We're in really good position in that market.
Well, I have heard people predict that it could be as long as 2 years, I don't know. I can't tell you, it depends. But they have predictions on demand and they have predictions on capacity and balancing the 2 of these guys said that they thought it might be as long as 2 years before the capacity equaled demand. I'm very optimistic that it's going to be a good market for a while.
Well, eventually, we think CWDM4 will be a larger market by volume. LR4 is a little more difficult product to make. But the 10-kilometer performance is something that a lot of -- awful lot of customers will demand in some part of their networks. I think they're both going to be very strong products over time. But the industry analysts that look at this industry predict that CWDM4 will be the largest in volume, but that there won't be much difference, I don't think, in the TAM.
Let's see. In reverse order, yes, we sell a 250-gig product today. And in terms of market share, it's hard to say. I hope it's big. There aren't many players, there aren't many guys in this industry that currently make this product. And right now, there's not -- but one that makes it in any volume to speak off. So I think that and given that virtually all the equipment companies who buy these things are going to -- will want to have 2 sources, I think we'll end up with meaningful share. And define meaningful is being 30% of the industry or 50% of the industry, I am not going to hazard a guess. It depends a lot on performance, it depends on shortages, it depends on quality and price and lots of other things that are yet to come.
I think there are some applications that are like that. But the consumer industry is such that volumes are high, the negotiations are tough. And my expectations that are -- and many of it in these cases, the OEMs are trying to make sure that they have specifications that are interchangeable between suppliers. That is that in many cases, the packages are the same, the outputs are the same, the configurations are the same. So you can have multiple sources for a drop-in product and that's a little different than a lot of the IC industry, where you go and try to spec in your chip into a slot in a design, but once you won that design win, then it's very difficult to get you out and almost nobody else in the industry has exactly the same pan out that you do. So it requires a design change to replace you or even to bring in a second source, you have to have a second board design. Anyway, I think that most of these consumer companies are trying to make sure that they have designed from the beginning so that they have multiple suppliers and interchangeable suppliers. So I think there's reason to believe that the sky high margins of the IC industry might not be possible in this consumer on applications. But I do think the margins will be quite good, and I think the business will be quite profitable.
The sales in China are going to be WSSs.
That's what I'm saying, too. Sales in China for Chinese networks or for export makes no difference that the sales will be wavelength-selective switches because the Chinese OEMs designed and build their own line cards.
Well, we have some for duals that are capable of CDC, and we have some that are singles that are, those single 1x9s that are broadcasting and select. So there's both.
I don't know. I haven't thought about it that way. I think about the DCO market as being different than the ACO market. And the densities that you can achieve in faceplates are higher with ACO than they are with DCO. And so there's a lot of OEMs that are going to prefer -- they're going to prefer ACO. And there may be more of a data center interconnect kinds of applications that may -- but it depends, that may prefer DCO. On the other hand, there are a lot of applications there where density will be important. So I don't know, I don't know how it's going to shake out. I think there's -- in the end, if you look at the LightCounting estimates, you'll see that there's significant market for both.
Well, Angela, thank you very much, and I want to thank everybody for tuning in today. We appreciate your taking the time to spend with us.

We have prepared some slides for today's earnings call. You can view them by connecting to the Investor Relations page of our website at finisar.com, click on Investors and scroll down to Webcast Archives and click. You will see's a listing for today's third quarter 2017 earnings call.


I am pleased to announce that Finisar achieved another all-time quarterly record for revenues and profits in our third quarter. Revenues were $380.6 million, an increase of $10.7 million or 2.9% over the second quarter and 23.1% over the third quarter a year ago. This growth was primarily from strong demand for our 100-gigabit per second transceivers. In addition, customer demand for wavelength-selective switches and ROADM line cards continue to be strong.


And I'm going to let Kurt take over and review the rest of the numbers for you. Kurt?
Thanks, Kurt. We expect our revenues for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 will be between $360 million and $380 million. Datacom revenues should grow by approximately $5 million, mostly from continued growth of 100-gigabit QSFP28 transceivers. This will be partially offset by lower sales of 10 gigabit and below short wavelength transceivers.


We expect telecom revenues to decline by approximately $15 million mostly from 3 factors: annual telecom price reductions, seasonality associated with Chinese New Year, and lower revenue from our 100-gig CFP transceivers in China.


We expect fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margins will be approximately 36%, primarily due to the impact of the telecom price reductions and our expectation of lower levels of revenue.


Fourth quarter operating expenses will be approximately $70 million. Non-GAAP operating margins will be approximately 17%. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share should be from $0.50 to $0.56.


We are optimistic about fiscal year 2018. We believe our revenues will grow again starting from the first quarter. We expect continued growth from the sales of 100-gigabit QSFP28 transceivers, mostly for hyperscale data centers. We are currently sold out on this product, and despite our continuing to add capacity, we expect that sold-out situation to last at least through the end of calendar year 2017.


In addition, we expect to finally achieve qualification in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 for both our 100-gigabit coherent CFP2 ACO transceiver and our ROADM line card for use in the Verizon Metro upgrade. Our qualification will be with a key OEM customer. We have already completed qualification of our CFP2 ACO at multiple customers and are in the qualification process with several others.


We also believe that Chinese service providers will begin domestic deployments of ROADMs in the second half of calendar 2017.


Finally, during the third quarter, we shipped many thousands of our high-powered VCSEL arrays for 3D sensing. We are continuing to add manufacturing capacity in anticipation of strong demand from this application in the second half of calendar year 2017.


And now with that, I'm going to turn it back over to Karen and open it up for questions.
Karen?

Question and Answer
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Well, 2011 happened in a much larger magnitude and much more suddenly. And it was -- there was way overcapacity -- or not overcapacity, over inflation in inventories. They were -- the inventory levels were very high levels, and so as a result, when there was this inventory correction, it was a really big deal. We don't believe that, that's happening. And I know -- I mean, there's a little -- there may be a little bit of inventory in the system because we're -- there's several products around the industry that are still in the sold-out condition, but it is not as pervasive as it was in 2011, and particularly, in the 2 big product lines that were driving us there.
This is the same source that said only a couple of weeks before that, that the demand for 100-gig optics is going to be at least 10x what anybody had ever forecasted, so I think there are sort of mixed signals there. From our standpoint, demand is really strong from a lot of directions, and it's not just OEMs like the one you mentioned, but it's predominantly driven by the hyperscale data centers. I don't see it being -- the type of situation being released for a very long time.
Well, the revenue levels and the potential for revenue levels in the second half of our next fiscal year are going to be -- or the next calendar year, actually, are going to be tens of millions of dollars. And I don't know exactly what our competitors have said, but they -- it's a huge potential for a lot of people in the industry. We are adding capacity, we're hiring people, we're adding equipment, we are increasing our capacity very dramatically. It is true that we manufacture on 4-inch wafers. We think our yields are higher on 4-inch wafers than they would be if we were processing 6-inch wafers. And so we made a very conscious decision to stick with, 4-inch. VCSEL wafers are very thin and very fragile.
Well, our issue on CFP is -- doesn't have to do with -- I mean, they're pretty system specific and they're pretty customer specific. I mean, we sell these things to a lot of people, but in these particular cases, there's going to have to be some component changes and, in one case, component and firmware changes just to be able to compatible with all of the systems from an OEM. Each OEM has -- they build lots of boxes. And each one of those boxes you have to qualify. Each one of them has a motherboard that has different characteristics. The chip that you're interfaced with and your optical device interfaces with has a different trace length, primarily the chip, the impedance matching is often quite different. We've had, in some pieces, the power supply and the characteristics of the power supply is really quite different. So anyway, we've run into a couple of those where we're having to make some changes to be compatible with a customer's motherboard.
Well, we think that CFP2 -- well, first of all, for the year, we're going to have very strong sales if we added up for all the quarters. But as we go into the next fiscal year, I would expect that CFP sales themselves are probably going to be flat, maybe. I don't know that they're likely to grow because the problem is CFP is migrating to CFP2 and we've got CFP4, and all of those eventually are going to go to QSFP28. So anyway, CFP has been a good product for a long time for us, but I -- we're not expecting a lot of growth out of it in the future.
I would expect in the next quarter or 2 is probably a good estimate. It could happen in a matter of -- I mean, in one case it could happen in a few -- a couple of weeks but I -- these are difficult things to predict sometimes because it's dependent upon what you're testing and a bunch of attention that the end customer has to pay to these issues.
I don't know exactly how to quantify that one. I mean, we are going to produce in calendar year '17 many, many more VCSELs than we've ever produced at our history. And we celebrated a few years ago our 100 million VCSEL that we had shipped, so I'm -- the capacity is pretty astounding for us. So -- but I'm -- it's not something that I can or I'm willing to exactly lay up how many wafers and how many dye we're going to produce.
Alex, I'm not sure. We had predicted internally a few quarters ago that we -- we thought that the 40-gig and 10-gig sales would decline in a modest rate for a long time, but we haven't seen that. We're still sold out on 40-gig. Our QSFP 40-gig product, I mean, we are at capacity. We got -- we can't ship all the stuff we got orders for. Our 10-gig is one of those where we have been surprised. We have not -- we are not sold out. We have had quarters in the last few quarters where we've had sales that were up substantially in a quarter and others where they were down modestly, but I don't -- I guess, I think that 10-gig is likely to be flat to down a little bit in the future, but I don't think it's going to be a very dramatic reduction because I think a lot of what we sell in 10-gig goes into enterprise data centers, and enterprise data centers aren't making a big transition to 100-gig. I mean, lot of them are still -- are upgrading from 1-gig to 10-gig and some of them are still going from -- no, it's actually from Cat5 cable 1-gig to optics on 10-gig. So we're...
Fiber channel was a bit slow in the market in the quarter for us.  I think fiber channel is -- has been a really stable business for us. It hasn't been a rapidly growing business for us, but it has been really stable. We have some great customers there. And it's -- it is -- the big threat that everybody talks about is, will cloud services take over all of these SAP and Oracle databases? And if they do, well, then it's not clear whether the big cloud services providers are going to run fiber channel in their cloud data centers. Now I will tell you, there are a lot of fiber channel sands in these big cloud operators today. And I don't know how that's going to expand, but anyway, overall, our expectations for fiber channel revenues are modest. I mean, we don't expect a lot of growth there.
I think, yes, that's probably right. We don't see a lot of variation in the pricing of that market and we don't -- and we make a lot of them. I mean, we're really competitive in that market because our volumes are so big.
The one area that was pretty strong was our tunable XFP, so it was -- we're sold out on that.
We're doing -- we're working with dozens of customers that are in consumer-related industries. Some are automotive, some are mobility devices, most of them have some 3-dimensional sensing as the goal, but for different purposes sometimes, but there's a lot of projects right now.
Well, we -- there are integrators that will combine light sources like our VCSELs with photodetectors with lensing, with special filters, with packaging, all of that, and we supply into those integrators who are contracting for the ultimate customer.
QSFP28 LR4, we sell to, I don't know, maybe hundreds of customers, and we're sold out. And we're going to stay sold out for a long time. And the product works really well, so I don't view there being an issue there.
No. We think the inflection is going to occur in the middle of the year '17.
Yes. We've now shipped a lot of units and the truck is pulling up to the dock because we have to make subsequent shipments that are considerably larger than what we have already shipped, and so we're -- it's rolling. My confidence in terms of the success of the project has grown. It's -- there's never a sure thing in this world, but at least there's -- at least at this point, it looks pretty good.
Well, I will tell you, the latest info we've got from different service providers and different equipment builders is that there will be some broadcast and select and some route and select. We originally thought -- go back a year, we thought that by the end of 2016, tenders would have been issued for deployments very early in 2017. Well, it didn't happen. It got pushed out. We supplied fairly large numbers of units, hundreds and hundreds of ROADMs or wavelength selective switches for -- what we would call in the U.S. field trials, they would call them small deployments in China. We then thought that these tenders would be issued in right after the first of the year. That didn't happen. And then we said -- we thought it would happen right after Chinese New Year. Well, that hadn't happened. And our latest input says it's probably a second half of event. And the tenders may occur between now and July, at least we're hoping for that, but we are assured by officials at the service providers and in the equipment companies that it's coming. And the only issue is going to be at which pace that they will deploy them. And there's a lot of -- automating the optical network is a new adventure for the service providers in China. And learning how to control and manage the networks is a complicated task for them, and so they're walking through it one step at a time. And I'm -- we're disappointed, obviously, that they haven't been able to deploy earlier, but I don't think that has dampened our enthusiasm for that business and that market because the volumes are potentially so large.
Yes.
Well, that's exactly what we are doing and what we have been in qualification for the last 1.5 years, trying to qualify our ROADM blade. So it is a complete ROADM blade with WSS channel monitor, EDFA processor, memory, software, you name it. It's an interface to their system, to their network management system. And we have been disappointed that we have been unable to qualify before now and -- but we think we have made it through all of the hurdles. We think we now have an acceptable device that is functional, and all of the very exacting system tests that are going to be run, we think, have been run. So we're very optimistic now that we will actually achieve AVL status and be able to ship in production quantities in, I don't know, probably the second quarter of our fiscal year '18.
Well, it's interesting that for us, we find that the -- selling the entire blade, the gross margins are -- the prices are twice as high as setting a wavelength selective switch, but the gross margins are actually a little bit lower. They're close but they're lower. And that's partly because we have to buy pump lasers and build EDFAs. We don't make pump lasers. We -- you then -- you wrap a lot of sheet metal and some circuit boards into this package as opposed to very exotic optics that go in a wavelength selective switch. And so the combination of all that, selling the sheet metal and the circuit board, along with EDFAs, means that the end of day, we get -- though the price is higher, the gross margin is a bit lower.
Well, the driving -- the biggest factor for us is the QSFP28 and the -- though we do sell it to hundreds of customers, the top few dozen are all in the cloud services business. They're operating these hyperscale data centers. So that is the biggest pressure that we see and that's the biggest demand that's going to stay, we think, strong for quite some time. I mean, yes, there are some other parts of our business in '18 that are going to be strong. We talked a lot about the 3D sensing and the VCSELs, I mean, that has exciting possibilities. We think our qualification for our ROADM line card and our CFP2 ACO finally for the Verizon project is again an exciting prospect for us, and again, for increased revenue. We just think -- there's a lot of things wavelength selective switches and our QSFP to the 100-gig in general. We think fiscal year '18 is going to be good.
Well, demand at this point is dominated by a very few customers. The number of prospects and the number of projects that we're working on that don't have a lot of demand yet, but where we're supplying prototypes, samples, small volumes, et cetera, for testing and for -- the building of systems, there are dozens and dozens of customers that are in that bag. So it's a -- obviously, it's a market that's going -- we think is going to have legs. The real question is going to be what are the apps that people are going to write once they have this ability to do precision 3D sensing, where they can do facial recognition at even some distance? I don't -- I'm not -- we're not a company that's going to write apps, but this is one of the things that's going -- there's going to be a lot of people who are going to turned loose that are going to be trying to write apps for these capabilities. So I'm -- anyway, there's a lot of excitement generally in the people that are working in this field. And if any of their estimates in the future come through, there aren't enough VCSELs capacity in the world to take care of this.
I think the qualifications to date are approximately 10, and we've got a number more that are in process. The -- and share in the future is really hard to predict. There aren't many suppliers, and we're -- and we'll be the largest company in the industry. We won't start with the largest volume in this particular product area, but as the largest supplier in this industry, we usually get recognized for that. I mean, we get a fair amount of attention, so I'm -- we will generate substantial volume in that market.
Yes. I think you're right. We expect the datacom business in '18 to be strong.
I think consolidation is an attractive idea in our industry. We're -- optics industry forever has been too fragmented. There's too many competitors and too many of us with too small a market share. I mean, we're the largest in the industry, but our market share is less than 20%, and that's not really a healthy industry. So I think consolidation in general is good. And the issue is -- and we obviously did a big convert to build our cash balances so that we are prepared in case we encounter or pursue some opportunity for consolidation. I can't speak to the possibilities or the probabilities. I can only tell you that we are currently open to the idea. We find the idea attractive, but it's all about -- at the end of the day, it's all about price. It's price and how do you get the shareholders of both companies to come out with an advantage for both, right? It's got to be -- it can't be a zero-sum game, so -- and that's often difficult to achieve.
Negative. All of QSFP28 is in datacom.

Comments,"I was hoping you could give us a little bit more granularity on the pressures on your gross margins and a little bit more on the mix of the decline in the business. It's our understanding that the majority of the Wireless products that are being sold in China are extremely low margins. If those are falling off, shouldn't that be a major offset to gross margin pressures? And then second, can you give us a little bit more clarity on what's going on in the transition on 100G datacom products into the data center for specifically the CFP to CFP2 and how that's impacting your revenues? How much of that is temporary as a result of that product transition and how long it will take for that to kick back in as a growth driver?
Could you give us any sense of when you think the revenue from CFP2 will reach -- or the combined revenue of CFP and CFP2 will reach the prior levels? Is there a shape to this transition curve that -- when do we get back to the prior levels where it's actually a growth engine, as opposed to just simply growing the CFP2? And how fast -- how far do you think the CFP1 falls off?
How about a follow-up here for, Kurt, on the gross margin question. If you think about the second half of the fiscal year. I know you don't like to give guidance out that far, but with the pending price cut negotiations, the ramp in LTE, do think you can expand your gross margins in the second half of the year or do think you're going to be in this 31% to 32% range?
Okay. Perfect and then, Kurt, maybe for you too, if you exclude the Wireless business within the datacom sales, did the datacom business grow sequentially?
If I look at it at the high level, optical trends of sophistication, it's becoming a bad business and it seems to be getting worse evident by, I guess the gross margin outlook. And even CNN has comments where their gross margins really took a step function down. Any thoughts on just kind of taking capacity out of the system? Consolidating? Are there any thoughts to kind of rationalize your CapEx plans, just so that we don't have these recurring concerns raised from investors?
Jerry, just on that. Is there a way to get a premium for your products so that if we're doing this for 15 years and we still have a step function down in price negotiations. How do we get a premium so that you get a return for all the investments in this sophisticated technology?
And lastly, any thoughts on the share repurchase considering your stock has been down quite a bit of this year and as we do see business returning, it's probably one of the best investments you can make?
Maybe a couple of interrelated ones on your datacom business, maybe asking in a slightly different way from a previous question. If I split the datacom business into your Wireless, kind of your Web 2.0 type of customers and kind of your general enterprise, looks like -- or looking forward here, is the base Enterprise business, do you expect that to grow or will that also be down, similar to the other 2 segments of that business?
Yes, in your current second fiscal quarter, yes.
Okay, fair enough. And then just a follow-up regarding some lumpiness, is that a veiled reference to Web 2.0 customers and if that's the case, how many customers make this a noticeable trend on your whole datacom business?
Okay. Maybe just a last quick follow-up for you, Kurt, on depreciation. It sounds like last quarter, depreciation stepped up $2 million and you're looking for another $2 million in this current quarter. Where do we see that going in terms of this CapEx build? How much higher can it go over 2, 3 or 4 quarters, whatever your visibility is into this current build at Wuxi?
Okay, so sounds like you're going to have a couple more quarters of $2 million or so per quarter step up and then maybe a more flattening after that?
I wanted to go back to the comment on datacom lumpiness and just try to understand between your cloud customers and who buy direct and OEM vendors. If you saw it more in one area or the other. And then you talked about Wireless in general being up during the third quarter, in the past when you've seen datacom downticks, they've been relatively short periods. I'm just curious how you think about the overall data center side of the business also for datacom, to start expecting -- to start to tick back up in the second half of the fiscal year?
And Jerry, just to make sure I understand. That's not just in Wireless but the data center side of your datacom as well.
You're expecting that to be better. Any kind of share with 40G BIDI that Cisco has been -- a program that's been ramping. There's some vertical integration in terms of 100G. Do you think that's impacting share or do you think what we're seeing is reflective of a kind of broader market?
Understood. And final question on the gross margin trend to the point of the second half -- or the next quarter seeing an uptick in Wireless. Kurt, where we sit right now, do you expect potentially for gross margins to go down further or can you make it  stable at these levels if we see Wireless transceivers pick up in the January quarter?
I feel like this has been asked but I'll guess I'm going to ask it again. Well, I mean, I'm hearing you guys guide down basically telecom, data center, datacom and Wireless part of datacom next quarter and you're saying that the quarter after, you have really good visibility to Wireless coming back. Do you have visibility at this point to anything else coming back besides just the Wireless piece? I mean, should we go ahead and model the rest of the datacom business or the telecom business to be sequentially up, and is there any reason to think it should be sequentially up in the third quarter?
Okay. And then what's the timing -- I just want to be clear on the timing of the CFP2 100G, when that will be ready, some -- you guys delivering it, as well as some demand in there for that to be a meaningful revenue contributor?
Okay. And then finally for me. I mean, with CapEx at these levels, that's in response to some unit demand that's out there. Given the way that the last -- things have been evolving, I mean, do you still feel as confident as ever that this high CapEx plan is correct? Does unit -- have your unit expectations generally speaking across-the-board taken a step back recently with these markets, with these kind of demand conditions? Or -- and initially, the bottom line, do you still feel confident in your aggressive CapEx plan?
So my question is very much in line with what Mike was just asking about. Just trying to understand the lumpiness you're referring to on the datacom customers. I would think it will still be helpful to at least break out between OEM vendors that do pull from inventory hubs versus the web scale type of companies that might have given you a little more visibility to their build plans, et cetera. So what I wanted to do is just be able to talk broadly about those 2 categories of customers, what that's happening. And on the web company side, what is your understanding of inventory because that's a category of customers that might actually hold some level of inventory?
Okay. Now a lot of questions being asked about 100G, largely CFP to CFP2 transitions. But obviously, that category is much broader than that including CXPs and the board-mounted optical assemblies, as well as the coherent products coming out. So can you also re-enter the 100G discussion from a timing perspective when we get some revenue growth including all of these other form factors of 100G?
Okay. And then just getting some sense on visibility in the telecom there, you do have some level of lead time from -- including your OEM vendors. So can you talk about what you're seeing on the road on designs, as well as the tunable XFP designs that were supposed to ramp?
A couple of things I was hoping to clarify. I don't think you've called out what the -- those Wireless business was in the July quarter, but it would help us if we could understand the order of magnitude. I understand it was a big driver of the growth and it's a big factor in the decline, but I feel like I need to know what percentage of the overall revenue is coming from this group of Wireless products.
Okay. And then when I look at the trends, you've had 5 quarters in a row prior to this one where your year-over-year growth was in excess of 20%. And for October, we're looking at the midpoint of 6% year-over-year growth. And I understand there's lumpiness and I'd like to try to see if you could help us look past lumpiness in terms of the shorter-term cycles and think about what you expect is the longer-term revenue growth. What's kind of the range you're thinking of for the full fiscal year even if you can't talk specifically to quarters?
And one last one for me then. Last quarter, you talked about one of the factors in pressuring the gross margin was around 100G, I guess a combination of price declines and volume. When we think about the pricing environment for your 100G products, how do you see the October quarter relative to the July quarter?
I guess, first, Kurt, I know that you're not providing specific guidance for gross margin for the back half of the year, but you did talk about mix being the key driver of the metric. So if we look at the back half of the year you're still talking about Wireless improving, which is a negative margin mix. You're talking about the 100G transition being ongoing, which could still be a headwind. The January quarter should have a month of annual telecom pricing negotiations baked in and you'll see a full impact in the April quarter. So I guess, my question is, if we just take all those negative mix impacts, is there anything on the horizon that you could point us to on the positive side that would help?
Okay. And I guess, just for any of you, you've provided a lot of reasons why the margin profile is getting pressured in October, whether it was depreciation, salary increases, the 100G or fixed cost absorption, but you didn't talk about pricing or competition. I would love your thoughts on those dynamics and if you saw or are seeing more aggressive pricing trends from your competition.
I guess, dovetailing off of that, maybe if we look at the CPRI business, specifically given your commentary on the competitive nature of the Chinese business, last quarter, I think Eitan in your prepared remarks you talked about plans to continue to cost-reduct these products even while you expand capacity. Can you talk to us where you're on this cost-reduction path? And could this product ever move from being significantly dilutive to the company's average gross margin to be more towards the corporate average, or does the mix need to shift from 3G and 6G towards 10G or will 10G even be dilutive to the margin profile?
Okay. And I guess -- just one follow-on I guess, on the 100G side, Jerry. You talked about shipping everything you can with CFP2 and that, eventually, the mix of CFP plus CFP2 is going to become a growth driver for the company later in fiscal year '15 or maybe in '16. Can you comment on when the gross profit becomes a driver from a pure dollar basis for the company given that you have higher competition, given that the ASP of the CFP2 is significantly lower than its predecessor and even though it is gross margin accretive still much lower. Just when will growth profit become a tailwind?
So the gross profit is not significantly lower from the CFP to CFP2. I think that it's inherently expected, but it's -- could be 15% lower or something to that nature?
I just wanted to do a quick follow-up because we talked about gross margin a lot. But if we have the same mix in 2015 and take your CapEx plans into account, would there be a point in any case in 2016 where margins would start to improve? Or is the comment on the no improvement there and the no investment there mean that you -- in a steady mix, you'd have a steady margin?
So in 2015, if we have wireless growth, you could still have margin improvement after the CapEx based on that different variables at the other side of the equation?
Okay. And then just switching gears, that small acquisition that you made in the quarter, the Oregon company, could you just talk about how vertically integrated that product now is, what you expect the cost savings to be there or the impetus for doing the integration and then did LightSmyth have any other customers and would they continue to have any?
So did that production move to China?
Did that production move to China?
Gentlemen, I wanted to focus on the telecom side of the market. As I look strategically on your business, datacom, you got a good market share lead there. The comparisons are tough, you've pretty much exhausted the different market opportunities that you can go after. But it seems to me, on the telecom side, there's a lot of leeway, there's a lot of potential market opportunities that you can accelerate or go after to drive growth in the business. So am I reading this correctly? Could you walk us through what the strategy might look like to continue to drive growth in the business and maybe some of the easier ways of doing so? And that's just sort of one piece of that. And then the second, as you talk about the telecom side, can you update us of the status of your qualifications with some of the customers maybe CNN, Cisco and others that were going to use your ROADM line cards, where we stand on that, have all your customers been qualified to deploy your ROADM them line cards? What's the demand's been at Huawei, for example, on the telecom side of the equation and where are we on the Verizon, metro build-out again for the telecom opportunity?
Eitan, on the coherent side, just kind of a quick follow-up there, are you getting a wink from your customers that they're -- the ones that are, for example, insourcing or vertically integrating coherent line cards today with their equipment chassis products, are you getting a sense that they are willing to, over time, outsource that line card to you or any other component manufacturer?","I'm just -- I'm trying to get a sense of the duration of the downturn considering the weakness that we're seeing from some of the carriers. Jerry, you pointed to the growth in bandwidth, the growth in video, which has been a consistent theme for many years. But I'm just trying to get a sense of how long do you think this current downturn that we might be in. And a subsequent question would be, how about -- how do we think about planning the business, monitoring -- moderating CapEx? Or are we still adding capacity, particularly in the 100 gig?
In '15? Okay.
And then, perhaps on your plans of just CapEx, is it full speed ahead? Do we throttle that back a little bit near term? Or it seems -- I'm just trying to get a sense of your expansion into your new plants and facilities.
Okay. Lastly, just competition-wise, it seems the traditional folks on telecom are now moving into datacom. If you're seeing any change in terms of dynamics in the datacom business competition-wise.
I had 2 questions. The first one is on revenue. You mentioned in the commentary that there was some lumpy demand from some datacom customers. And I just wanted to understand if those are OEMs or the cloud players. And on the gross margin, I wanted to understand, given that April has a slow quarter of telco price reductions, if you feel that the trends with revenue growth and price reductions, do you think April gross margins could tick down from current levels? Another question is on consolidation. Jerry, we've seen several moves in the last few months from different players in terms of consolidation in the space, and I wanted to get your thoughts on that.
So these would be more end customers, kind of the data center operators rather than the OEMs, is that right?
And the final question if you think about kind of the revenue trend, you talked about optimism going into calendar '15. Do you think we're, from a revenue perspective, bottoming out in the October quarter and expect quarter-over-quarter growth to continue? Do you have visibility for that going to 2015?
A couple of just very targeted questions and then a broader one. First, would there be growth in the guidance that you're giving for the upcoming quarter if we were to strip out the contribution to the quarter-to-quarter growth from China wireless sales?
And can you give us any quantification or qualitatively what the relative contribution of that piece is? Because it's such a big swing. It's so different from the rest of the business, particularly on the margin front.
Is that China wireless piece the predominant variance between the high end and the low end? Or is it other factors?
The second question is on the CFP product line to the CFP2 product line in the datacom segment. Can you quantify or give us some sense of what the trajectory of the combined revenues of those are? Is the erosion in the older CFP still a greater factor than the ramp in the CFP2? Or has that started to stabilize and nose up? Where are we on that? I was sort of under the impression that it would be in the June/July timeframe when that went positive.
Okay. So the last question is, just can you give us some sense of what you think your long-term growth targets might look like at this point and what you think the long-term gross margin and operating margins might look like? I mean, what is your thought on terms of what the company should be delivering under reasonable conditions in terms of growth, gross margins and operating margins?
Just a follow-up on the datacom 10G. I mean, it was down; 40 and 100 was up. I'm curious, the declines in 10G, is it more just the lumpy aspect to the transition to 40 or 100 going faster than anticipated? Or is it ASP reductions? I'm just trying to get a sense for where are we in that 10G upgrade cycle in the data center.
So Jerry, I know there's -- you're expecting growth for the business and growth in datacom. Do think we can get growth in 10G next year? Or is it the transition to the other speeds that are going to provide that growth?
Last question. Can you just talk about the range of the ASP reductions for the telco business? I'm assuming it's in that 10% to 15%, but what end of the range would it be at?
LLC. I just want to hit on industry consolidation again. I know you guys can't comment on any specific things in the works, but I'm just wondering is there anything that would keep you from doing a large deal, like conceptually, or I guess, sort of philosophically? And if there were a large opportunity that they were around, is that something you guys would be willing to participate in given -- if it was the right fit?
Great. So I'm just wondering, you guys talked about 100 gig QSFP28. I'm just wondering if you have any more visibility into just the switching, 100 gig cycle, when things finally kind of go from the Edge to the top-of-rack switches, or I should say the aggregation switches. For 100 gig, do you see that -- I've been hearing sort of middle of next year, you could kind of start -- we start seeing 100 gig switching systems. Like, what are your thoughts on that?
Okay. Just one final one, housekeeping. I know you guys didn't show your datacom and telecom trend. You kind of just gave us some changed up numbers quarter-over-quarter. Is it your intent to stop disclosing that detail?
Jerry, you touched about this in one of the last answers, but I wanted to go back to 40 gig, which seems, according to the double 00 [ph] numbers on the Ethernet side, to be really ramping in the -- it looks to be with the Web 2.0 vendors, including Microsoft. And I'm wondering if you see activity across all of those big players and what you can tell us about the application that it's being used for and how quickly you see that being deployed across more than just Microsoft, who has talked about it publicly?
Okay. And do you see a lot of -- is everybody moving in the same pace? Or is there opportunity for this to be a pretty good ramp as we move through calendar 2015?
Okay. And also, a follow-up on the consolidation, just a specific question. We've seen, I guess, Koch Industries with the Molex and then going out and buying Oplink, which I guess, traditionally was more of a telecom player. Can you talk about where you think that strategically is going and what that means for the industry? Because it feels like there's been some changing of the names of some of the companies, but the actual number of companies competing hasn't shifted that much yet as we talk about consolidation.
A couple of questions. First, can you talk a little bit about the $2 million excess in obsolete inventory? And looking at the total inventory, it did go up quite a bit sequentially. Last quarter, some of the increase was due to an acquisition. This quarter, can you just talk about what you saw from the hub pull from the OEM companies and perhaps the linearity of that? And then lastly, what you guys are thinking when, given your guidance, what you're thinking about the hub pull on that guide?
But can you say what the products were that was in that $2 million?
Okay. And then the OEM pull. So the pull, at least looking back in Q2, it was as forecasted predominantly? Because the reason I'm asking is a number of OEMs have missed their October or September quarter numbers and guided down. So I'm just curious whether you saw any kind of deviance versus forecast in the OEM and any linearity of that.
Okay. Last question. Eitan, can you talk about the timing of the 100 gig coherent in terms of first revenue? The $400 million market number sounds interesting. Who else do you see really modularizing the 100 gig? And do you think you'll be first to market?
On the telecom side of things, I was wondering if you could talk about a little bit geographically as we look into the next quarter. And then any sort of commentary you may have on the previous quarter, if you think that's helpful. And then the second question, just around the datacom side of things as we look into 2015, Jerry, do you think there's been enough kind of competition that has come into the fray that we should think about you guys as more growing with the market? Or do think that there's more share taking to be had in 2015?
This is Rob Richardson on for Patrick today. Just kind of wanted to get the housekeeping question out of the way. Kurt, did you mention what the top 10 customers as a percent of revenue were or number of 10% customers were in the current quarter?
Great. And then if -- I guess, Jerry, if we kind of shift back to datacom, and I'm thinking kind of more with the wireless transceivers. Was kind of the weakness in there derived from any geography? Was it China-driven or from somewhere else?
So if you think about that -- so my kind of understanding was that's a pretty dilutive product to the overall corporate average gross margin. Just kind of wondering, what kind of played in the margin in the quarter? If you saw kind of that weakness in the wireless transceivers, would have expected maybe a little better gross margin? Just looking for some thoughts on that.
Got you. Great, I appreciate that. And then, I guess, kind of one last question, if I may. So I just want to make sure I understood the expectations for the next quarter, thinking about the split between datacom and telecom. Are we thinking datacom should be up year-over-year, with telecom down to possibly flat? Or is there -- what's kind of the mix -- or your thoughts on that?
Yes, sure, quarter-over-quarter.
Just a quick number I missed in the prepared remarks was the actual CapEx in the quarter.
Great. Okay, I appreciate that. And just following up on the commentary around the data center and the 40 gig and lumpiness. It does sound that you're pretty confident about that business coming back. And so I'd like to try to get a better understanding of the dynamic of the weakness in the reported quarter and the recovery in the coming quarter. How much of that is simply a single customer or a few customers and project delays versus dynamics regarding either competition, pricing or production? Essentially, I'm trying to get a sense of whether this is pure lumpiness of activity and concentration or whether there's a bigger picture trend, given that one of your competitors talked about a pause in 40G in the coming quarter where this just sort of ebbs and flows. Sorry for the long-winded question.
And just going back to the China wireless. In your July quarter, I think you talked about some component shortages in the supply chain. I believe it was mainly some amplifiers that just slowed down in activity in China. And I think we had the impression that this problem was getting resolved and that China would ramp for wireless build-outs in your October quarter. And so to what degree were you surprised by weakness in China? And what's the cause? Is it that they didn't resolve that supply chain problem or something else?
I guess, what I'm trying to get a sense of is what was the reason? Is it that the customer is having a supply chain issue? Or are they making a choice to simply spend less because they're trying to control CapEx or have weaker demand? I'm trying to understand the source of the weakness.
Going back to this lumpiness in the 40 gig area, we hear a lot about competitive pricing dynamics between the various Web 2.0 players. Do think there's been a change in economics for these Web 2.0 guys because of all the aggressive pricing across that landscape and therefore, that's trickling down to your level and causing the projects to move around a lot?
Hopefully. I hope that some of the other guys can handle that. Getting into telecom a little bit, what happens -- we hear a lot about 100 gig and the customer base, the OEMs becoming a little bit more vertically integrated. So what are the product areas that are most at risk for you as that happens in 100 gig?
Correct, yes. Yes.
I have a couple ones. One, on this China business, the wireless transceiver business, is there any visibility into the duration of that deployment? I mean, when does that start to roll off? Kind of give us your thoughts to the extent you could see that or hear from the OEM partners you're working with.
Okay. So it sounds like you feel that this business has another 2-year type of run rate. And when it does roll off, I mean, what are you hoping to substitute that revenue with? Is it going to be just as you were saying, 40G, 100G and maybe some of the telecom starts to ramp? Is that sort of what the strategy is to kind of tack on growth here? Or is there something else in the pipe?
Okay. So it sounds like your footprint in China can help you maybe get into some other of those 4G LTE cloud RAND deployments elsewhere in the world if they do commence?
Got you. All right. And then just wanted to revisit a few items, kind of old topics, if you will. One is maybe to Eitan on the silicon photonics front. I mean, what are you guys doing on that front? I mean, JDSU recently talked about some partnerships that they're considering or are working on. Not that I'm expecting you to announce anything, but just kind of walk us through your thoughts there. That would be very helpful. And then the second one, just on the Cisco relationship. Cisco switch business was actually pretty strong this past October quarter. But the softness you had seen, it sounds from the results I'm looking at, it sounds it was more weighted towards that Web 2.0 vertical than maybe one of your largest customers, OEM customers. And just kind of revisit that customer, if you will, and give us some thoughts around the traction and strength of your business there.
Just a couple of questions for me. I'll start in the 40 gig datacom. I'm curious what you think your share is there, whether it's -- if you view yourselves as #1 in the market and how that compares with the overall datacom share. And then also, are you seeing or do you know of any component shortages sourcing into that market specifically?
Okay. Just a follow-up on that question on capacity. Is there a restraint on you adding capacity fast enough so you can relieve those constraints? Or is there equipment or other things that are preventing you from doing that?
Got it. Okay, that's helpful. Second question, Jerry, a follow-up to your responses in an earlier question regarding competition. Specifically, I think you mentioned some more competitors. I'm assuming they're coming from China. A couple -- a kind of 2-part question on that. Are you seeing this coming in as high as the 10 gig speed here? And if so, is this having an impact outside of China?","Question about the guidance. The range implies a broad range of revenues with very little on the margin side. Is there a large order in there that you're factoring into that guidance? Or is there some sort of mix that I'm not seeing on the margin side of the guidance?
So that could be some variability in the mix, that's the kind of impact.[ph]
But it's not one big contract out there that's providing us with that big range?
Okay, understood. I wanted to go a little bit more detail into the 40 gig side. It sounds like the hyperscale data centers are still doing well, and I was hoping you could talk to us a little bit about the pricing dynamic and the competitive forces going on in that market in terms of other players, given the growth prospects there.
Is there a similar pricing pressure to the telecom side of the business right now?
So just want to start with gross margin impact from the yield loss, would you mind -- would you quantify that a little bit for us? And does your guidance for the coming quarter assume that yield loss? And I guess, relatedly, like maybe you could talk about the revenues associated with this opportunity if they're coming in next quarter. Did you see any this quarter? How big is it, et cetera?
Great. Okay, I'd love to hear a little bit -- we just heard about 40 gig, 100 gig strength in datacom. Is it fair to say this is driven by the ramp of CFP2? Is that becoming a more substantial revenue contributor? I guess, I'm assuming it's a lot bigger than the Vixel-based 100 gig. Could you use any kind of texture on -- with that CFP2 contributing, perhaps even tell us kind of the rough proportion of 100 gig revenue coming from CFP2?
That's interesting. Are you seeing any -- I mean, I assume this is the -- the CFP2s are going to systems that are not with your largest datacom customer. Are you seeing the CPAC module out there? Any kind of competition from that?
Okay. Last question, just telecom. Obviously, it's very challenging around for everybody here so you're not alone. But any thoughts on the outlook for the year, 14% year-over-year decline. I mean, is that how we should think about telecoms sort of through this year? Or is there reason to think that telecom could get significantly better?
You made some really strong improvements in operating expenses reduction during the quarter. I'm just trying to get a sense of what part of that is actual changes that you've taken out in OpEx, or is it really rather expenses moving from quarter-to-quarter?
Okay, that's helpful. And gentlemen, on the gross margin, recognizing the telecom price reduction is the mix and the volume, are you also starting to see intensifying competition on 40, and potentially 100 gig, and so if there' some preemptive [indiscernible] to kind of maintain your market share in these 2 transport speeds implied in the gross margin?
Okay. Lastly, as it relates to competition and industry structure, Jerry, now that you had a chance to look at the Form 10 from JDSU, what are your thoughts in terms of consolidation? Are you more interested, less interested as to say your thoughts on just going at it alone or offsetting some price competition with greater scale?
Great. Just one from me, around the web scale guys and I guess, in particular, kind of the Web 2.0 guys. Can just talk a little bit structurally, about your visibility there and then just kind of the activity that you're seeing on the go forward? As we look at some of the CapEx estimates going forward, they are slowing some, but just want to get a sense for how you're thinking about that and how your visibility has evolved over time.
I have 2 questions. First, on the 13 weeks versus 14 weeks. I know you had mentioned that there's some benefit in the 14 weeks partially offset by Chinese New Year. If we look out to July, and if you just look historically, if you return back to a 13-week quarter, has that traditionally meant kind of a revenue decline or less of an increase? How has that worked out historically? And how do you expect it to play out this year?
And is it linear, Kurt? I mean, would 13 weeks and 14 weeks, this is 7% difference, should we think about that, or is it not that linear?
Understood. And then gross margin, I think, you mentioned that the impact of the lower yield was about 75 basis points. You have some ongoing impacts. So if I look past April, you don't have the telco price reductions going to July. The CapEx starts to level off, hopefully the yield issues, which still continue to impact this quarter, start to lighten. How should we think about gross margin trend line at the April quarter?
And then how should we think about impact if the yield issues are fixed and the CapEx declines, just -- those 2 factors. What kind of a swing factor do those create on gross margin?
Understood. And final question on telco. Jerry, Eitan, this quarter, the level of telco revenues is the lowest revenue in 5 years since you started breaking it out. And I know, I understand the carrier CapEx challenges and still waiting for metro, but how do you think about this business in terms of investing in telco given it continues to decline as a percentage of revenue and hitting kind of multiyear lows at a time where the market's not healthy but for your competitors it's not as challenging as it seems for you as well?
I understand, just [indiscernible] in that 70 -- I mean, $80 million to 90 million for long time. Now we're closing -- probably closer to $70 million. I'm just wondering from a run rate perspective as things get better, should this be 30% of revenues? And 40% -- is it a $100 million run rate? Just trying to understand, given the steep declines we've seen in telecom, what the real run rate of this business is if you start getting back to growth areas?
I wanted to just check on this, just to keep our lives simple. In terms of the OpEx trend with the extra week, you're suggesting April would be around $70-ish million, $69 million, $70 million, and then July operating expenses should be similar to the January level. Is that the way we should think about it?
Okay. And then, you talked about the web scale guys. I haven't heard much mention of submarine exposure and I know a number of the OEMs, your customers in the system side, have been talking about submarine opportunities, both literally under ocean or opportunities at landing sites, I'm wondering if you could give us some sense of how big an opportunity that is for your business and what the growth trends are?
And does that fall in your telco or your datacom segment?
Okay. And then several quarters back, the increased exposure to China and China backhaul affected your gross margin. I'm just wondering where those projects are in light of what looks like flattening CapEx in calendar '15 in China as China Mobile slows and maybe Telecom and Unicom ramp. Can you talk a little bit about the dynamic of China and how that affects your business?
Okay. And then you've talked about long-term, targets particularly, the gross margin trending towards the mid-30 range. I just wanted to do a check on how you feel about those targets and whether we should think about trending towards the mid-30s over a period of a couple years, or whether you feel like you can exit fiscal '16 significantly higher. Just want to get an idea what kind of slope we should think about towards the longer-term targets?
Yes. I wanted to dive a little bit into the OpEx side of your prepared remarks. You talked about significantly decreasing operating expenses, but then during this kind of Q&A, you talked about that January is at historically low levels giving some pushouts of R&D projects. So should we think about Finisar as being in a period or perhaps exiting a period where they've invested aggressively in R&D and we should start to see that line item growth be below the revenue growth rate that you're in somewhat of a harvest mode? Or conversely, should we tend to think that OpEx should relatively pace the revenue growth rate over an intermediate term period?
Great, that's helpful. And then, I guess, Jerry, I wanted to dig into datacom mix in the quarter and how we should think about it on a go-forward basis. You did talk about hyperscale being up a little bit. I think wireless, you did talk about some sequential growth. Can you give us a little bit on your thoughts on the enterprise business on the Fibre Channel and Storage side of the business? And then also any thoughts that you have on the transaction between Avago and Emulex and does that change the competitive landscape or impact your customer base at all?
Any comments on Avago and Emulex?
A quick one for Jerry. One of your competitors in datacom had a problem with the 40 gig components in the quarter. So I was wondering if you saw a benefit in the January quarter revenues by the April quarter guidance due to share gains [indiscernible] Web 2.0 compete.[ph]
All right. [indiscernible] Sorry didn't mean to interrupt. Then a follow-up for Eitan. Can you just give an update on how the samples of the 100 gig coherent CFP2 modules have been received? And just also on the timing, when do you think that ramps?
So it's a complicated question but I will ask it anyway because your datacom mix is as high as it's ever been. So if we were to exclude the impact from the yield loss on the optical engine, and it sounds like the impact on the mix from the wireless transceivers is -- it's been the same as in the past couple of quarters. This would suggest that your rest of the business gross margins are not even close to what you did about a year ago, which was about 37%. So I wonder if you can walk me through what's going on in the rest of the business. Are you seeing more pricing pressure in datacom? Or is it just that telecom, given the lower base of revenues you're experiencing probably, onetime pretty low gross margins for this quarter and we would eventually expect that to go back to where it was once telecom picks up. If you can just walk me through what's going on with the gross margins, it would be great.
Really appreciate it. And then just going on the business, if we split up by -- split it up by speeds, has it changed from last quarter, meaning that 40 gig is the fastest-growing part of the business and 10 gig remains the largest portion of revenues?
It's still the same?
Just want to follow up on this 100 gig CFP comment that you just had, Jerry. Given some of your competitors or many of your competitors are out maybe a little bit earlier competing in the CFP2 versus what they were in the CFP4, the original CFP, can you just talk about what are going to be the dynamics of winning opportunities? Is it going to be time-to-market, performance, price and then how do you see a more competitive CFP2 business impacting your overall business?
Okay. And how does CFP2 margins compare to corporate average?
Okay, great. And then one other question. You were talking about -- there's a question about consolidation in the industry. And if you were to play a role in consolidation, what would you be looking for? I mean, would you look to just simply gain scale? Would it be eliminate a competitor, to make it a less challenging competitive environment? Would it be to pick up a technology? What are your thought processes there and...
Great. I just have one question. You've already indicated somewhat how we should think about 1Q revenues. So if we look beyond the current quarter, 2 quarters out, on the gross margins, 2 quarters out, are you willing to say that 4Q should mark the bottom and then we should be up in 1Q sequentially a bit?
A couple of quick ones. I was just wondering, the depreciation expense that was going through the gross margin due to construction of the facility in China, when does that, Kurt, begin to alleviate? And is that a multiyear effect, is that a couple of quarters effect?
And how much basis points did that contribute in the quarter, that affect of depreciation expense in the gross margin?
Okay, all right, excellent. And then, again, a quick one on telecom side. I know a lot of questions have been asked on that front, but I'm just curious like, the competitors, one of the major competitors there had seen their ROADM business actually snap back sequentially. We want to know if you could -- were willing to talk about your ROADM business. But it sounds from the numbers that, that business had declined. So I don't know why you're not seeing exactly the positive impact of perhaps even the 100G metro deployment for AT&T, CNET [ph] reported this morning and talked about some metro projects already in effect. I know there's Verizon metro and that's potentially where you will be playing with the flex grid ROADMs. But we were trying -- what I'm trying to sort of get to is different architecture on the ROADM side that will begin to give you growth in that business and you just sort of excluded at the moment from the current metro projects that are going on. If you could comment on those 2 major carriers deployments, that would be helpful.
Okay. And if I may and I apologize for being that specific. I recall again going back a few years -- top 3 customers of yours were Cisco, Alcatel-Lucent and Huawei and Cisco sort of hanging in there and certainly had a nice quarter. And perhaps you were seeing the wind of that, this quarter as well, and then going into the next quarter. But what about the Alcatel-Lucents and the Huaweis, I mean, are you seeing other customers replacing them, are you seeing them snapping back, how these major customers of yours are performing at the moment? Are you happy with that performance?
First of all, regarding your datacom sales increasing 8.5%, I was wondering if you can go over the mix between 40G, 100G and wireless?
Okay. I see, wireless was #2. And what about for your outlook, should we expect similar dynamics or 40G and 100G to be growing faster than wireless in the first quarter?.
Got it. And then moving to telecom. I was wondering -- Eitan already talked about WSS, but what about tunable XFP and you think you can just -- if you're not going to break it out, specifically, can you just tell us what the rough mix is between WSS plus tunable XFP in terms of overall telecom sales?
And how much is a 10G telecom, or 10G and below telecom?
Okay, all right. And then, did you talk about price decline, what the actual price decline was?
Got it, got it. And I'm wondering -- I was wondering if you can tell us Emulex what their percentage revenue?","Can you give us a little bit more granularity on some of the individual products? What segments are improving, what segments are under pressure? What you're seeing in terms of scale out data center builds? What's going on with the ROADM business? Those type of metrics, plus a whole lot about products in the discussion.
Within the wireless, is -- I assume that's mainly CPRI. Are you expecting that to continue to come off? I assume that the brand builds are moderating a little bit this year from last year. Is that the right way to think about that?
And just one last question on the weak stuff. Can you give us your sense, is it right to think of that as 14 over 13, that's the percentage adjustment? Or is it right to think of that as some modestly lower adjustment in that when we think about the top line?
It sounds like 4% to 5% kind of number is probably the right number to use in the comp?
If I look at from year-over-year, a year ago you had 13 weeks. This year you'll have 13 weeks, so the comparisons are more reasonable. And then the midpoint of that is actually a decline on the year-over-year basis. So are there particular products you're seeing more of a slowdown in the year-over-year basis?
Okay. And Kurt, if we look at the wireless weakness last year, I think some of that was related to China and their ramping 4G in the mix of products there. The -- what are we seeing in terms of China this year as they expand their 4G network? If you could give us some color, that would be helpful.
Okay. That's helpful. And lastly, as we think about just the steady state and the growth in the data centers and your opportunities there, any thoughts of recalibrating how we should be thinking about OpEx on an annual basis? Also sales and marketing and then also R&D?
Jump right in, Kurt, I guess I was a little bit surprise that you're only guiding for a gross margin increase 20 basis points sequentially coming off of full impact of telecom pricing in the April quarter. What is driving this? Is there any -- is -- are you seeing more aggressive datacom pricing? Are there any mix assumptions that you've baked in that are impacting the margin guide? And can you elaborate a little bit -- I think it was during Eitan's prepared remarks, where you stated that you're seeing some increased competition. Can you elaborate on that?
Is that increased in telecom versus datacom? Is that increased in a certain speed, 100G, 40G, 10G? Is that across ROADMs, WSS? Anywhere that you can point to where it's more exacerbated?
In single mode versus multimode?
Okay. That's helpful. And then can you elaborate a little bit on your 100G business? Can you help us perhaps understand the relative contribution to datacom versus telecom segments? And then could you give us an update on both kind of your product road map for the QSFP28 and also the coherent CFP2? I believe you're shipping samples last quarter and would love to get your thoughts on when we could see volume shipments of that product.
Okay. And then just last one if I may is can you comment on how we should think about datacom versus telecom in the July quarter relative to the flat -- flattish sequential overall revenue guide?
Just back to this question of datacom competition, I mean, obviously Innolight filed today and they're obviously growing very fast in the datacom space. And I'm kind of wondering if these are one of the guys that you're seeing from a competition from? Just at a higher level in these large scheme of data centers, I mean, how are you feeling about your market share? Do you expect to maintain that? Or might you back away from some of this business if pricing gets a bit irrational? Just could you comment more on that sort of the competition in hyperscale data centers?
So just on 40 Gb, it sounds like that was down sequentially. Would you attribute that to lumpiness? Is there any kind of potential or maybe already happening wait for effect for hyperscale data centers?
Okay. And on 100 Gb, it sounds like that was up sequentially. I'm wondering, is that mostly driven by CFP2? Or I think, where are we in this CFP versus CFP2 transition? Can you give us a little detail on that?
Okay. Last one then I'll pass. WSS module, that strength, is that financially [ph] the green shoots of the metro deployments of 100 Gb or just seasonality? Or just any kind of -- is it long haul versus metro? Just any kind of color on the WSS strength and whether or not you expect that to kind of continue to the year would be very helpful.
My first question is just if I try to quantify the impact of the extra week offset by Chinese New Year. I think in the past, Kurt, you've mentioned that, that would be approximately low-double-digit million [ph] positive impact. Is that the right way to think about it? Where your $320 million have been essentially flat quarter-over-quarter somewhere in the 306, 308 number? And would this quarter's midpoint be up about 3%? Is that the right way to think about it?
Sure. And was telco a little bit better and datacom a little bit lower than expected if you look at sort of how April played out?
Understood. And on the higher competition comment, I know you mentioned that as both single mode and multimode. Is it at the higher speed as well as 40, 100? Is it sort of across-the-board on speed? Is it more 10 Gb and wireless? Can you give us some sense of where that higher competition is?
Okay. Understood. And then final question on web scale, can you talk about web scale players as a percent of revenue sort of where they're trending to? And with the talk about 25 Gb servers, 100 Gb in the data center, do you -- when do you think that starts to become sort of a demand driver? It seems like aggregation speeds in the data center today are still mostly at 40 and 100 Gb in the data center. When do you start to think of that as a real revenue driver?
And so if I look at this quarter up, kind of low-single-digit percent quarter-over-quarter, if you x out the timing issues, do you expect sort of that trend line to continue, Jerry, given 100 Gb opportunity going into the second half of the year?
Quick one for Eitan and then one follow-up for Jerry. But Eitan, given we saw some growth in WSS and tunables, I'd just like to gauge your confidence of a telco metro-optical cycle starting, whether it's beginning of next year with a little bit of build in the second half, but just your conviction on this now versus 3 months ago.
Just one follow-up for Jerry then. On the datacom business, I'd be curious to know like how good is the visibility there? If you can kind of comment on [indiscernible] forecast, or is the book-to-bill been above 1 recently? Anything you can help us out with visibility would be great.
I want to go back to the data center, which I know has gotten a lot of attention. But just the comment on the 25 Gb happening, I wanted to verify that that's your second half, but the calendar '16. And then could you just give us a little bit more detail, have all the major hyperscale guys standardized on 40? Or do you think that some of the lumpiness is the decision that's waiting for -- to build out the 25 Gb versus the 40 Gb roll out?
So the [indiscernible] that's timing issue? Or it's not an architecture decision?
Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess, Kurt, I was just curious. If you look at the mix, and I know there's some variability here and you talked about building out the second 2 floors in China, what kind of -- what's the plus and the minuses we could expect in gross margin going out for the year? What would be your best case scenario if you got some operating leverage or gross margin leverage on some volume through the China facility at the end of fiscal '16?
Just wondering, you guys indicated that wireless competition -- or competition for your wireless products was picking up a little bit. And I know that those products were -- have historically been kind of lower-margin products. So just kind of wondering, at what point do you decide to walk away from that business in wireless? Are you anywhere near that decision? And then how aggressive can you be in terms of pricing in that product line?
Okay. And then kind of get -- stay on this gross margin topic, what would it take to get gross margins up to, say, the 32% or 33% range? I know you don't want to give a time frame. But I mean, can you get there based on simply volume? Do you need all these -- execution of all these cost improvements in wireless and optical engine and other products to get there? Do we need a relief of the competitive dynamics? I mean, what are going to be the big catalysts here or could be?
Yes, I understand that. But just kind of -- is it possible to rate the factors -- or rank the factors that could potentially improve the gross margins, let's say, 32% or 33%?
Okay. And final question, are there any products that are in the horizon that you're going to introduce? I know you guys talked about all the R&D to drive new product development. Is there anything on the horizon that you feel like could give you some more favorable pricing dynamics?
This is
in for Simon. I wanted to ask a little bit about operating expenses. I understand the OpEx next quarter will have these exceptional expenses from sales conference and the restricted stock units. But how do we think about OpEx on a normalized basis going forward?
Okay. That's helpful. I wanted to ask you, how do you guys -- what are you guys thinking about the 100G market for intra data center optics? And kind of your timing for how long it takes to develop in terms of timing and ramp PS [ph]?
Yes, right, right.
When are you expecting to introduce the form factors at the CLR4 or the PSM4? Is that the same time frame?
Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And regarding the competitive piece, I just wanted to dig just a little bit more there. I guess, do you consider your key competitors inside the data center, is it still Oclaro, JDSU? Is Avago still one of the guys that you see when you talk about that space also?
Okay. So it's primarily in the Web 2.0 space then, okay.
And lastly, I just wanted to see if I could get a sense of your view around acquisitions. Maybe not any specific acquisitions, although I think some people have one in mind specifically. But just kind of trying to get a sense of your priorities, your logical priorities regarding the consolidation sector in general and your thoughts on consolidation.
Couple for me. First of all, I think you referenced gross margins doing a little better than expected due to their yields in the optical engine. Wondering how good those are compared to overall corporate averages and where you think that can go. And really, where can the volumes go? And can we see a positive mix shift from that quarter or 2 down the road?
Okay. And this is a product that we're seeing from just single customer, or are there more than one? Or do you expect more than one here in the future?
Okay. Is there any time frame by which this becomes a meaningful product category for you like a year out as an example? Any clarity you can give for this -- on that, Jerry?
Okay. Appreciate the detail there, Jerry. One follow-on question here on the topic of CFP2 coherent. How would you play out the competitive environment here? Where do you think your share will sit or your share rank? Any general thoughts as we look out couple quarters a year or so? How should we view that?
Okay. Eitan, how important is it to have a 200 Gb versus just 100 Gb for that product category?
So I'm a little confused about exactly what's going on in Wuxi. Just wondering if you could give us a little bit more clarity around it. It sounds like on the one hand, you have a little bit less CapEx in the quarter that just occurred, that you are accelerating CapEx spend for the upcoming quarter a little bit above what you had expected before. Is that a function of you changing the rate of which you're building those new rooms out and therefore choosing to also the pattern of the spend in order to facilitate that? Or is that going to cause -- are you behind schedule or on schedule relative to the original time line for the build completion that you originally scheduled for the end of April? And relative to that extra capacity, is that a reflection -- should we read into it a reflection of faster transition out of Shanghai and into this building? Where are we in actually shutting down the Shanghai side of it? But could you give us some of the pings and pongs on that? It's kind of hard for us externally to track it?
Okay. So just so I understand, the costs associated with this transition, we've been carrying around a lot of cost for training, busing people back and forth between the various facilities. I assume that, that some of these costs that you've been carrying start to fall out as you bring up the capacity over the next couple of quarters. Is that the right way to think about it? And isn't your cost structure substantially lower here than it is in Shanghai? Therefore, shouldn't those 2 factors help you deliver improvement in margins as we go over the next 2 or 3 quarters, other things being equal?
Is it fair to say that a good part of the pressure in your margins over the last 18 months has been the result of some of this transitionary pressure and as this falls out, you should get some of that margin back that you've given up? Or is that too naïve and it's really a function of product and volumes and you actually have had competitive pressures that are altering the equation? And I guess at the end of the day, are you guys more or less or just about the same in terms of how bullish you are about your business? It sounds really muddled to us from the comments. You don't want to seem to want to commit to any meaningful trajectory on change on anything, whether it's product lines or growth or cost structure. Why so muddled?
That was very helpful. It just helps to get the sense of whether you guys are bullish or nervous.
Can you give us a little bit more granularity on some of the individual products? What segments are improving, what segments are under pressure? What you're seeing in terms of scale out data center builds? What's going on with the ROADM business? Those type of metrics, plus a whole lot about products in the discussion.
Within the wireless, is -- I assume that's mainly CPRI. Are you expecting that to continue to come off? I assume that the brand builds are moderating a little bit this year from last year. Is that the right way to think about that?
And just one last question on the weak stuff. Can you give us your sense, is it right to think of that as 14 over 13, that's the percentage adjustment? Or is it right to think of that as some modestly lower adjustment in that when we think about the top line?
It sounds like 4% to 5% kind of number is probably the right number to use in the comp?
If I look at from year-over-year, a year ago you had 13 weeks. This year you'll have 13 weeks, so the comparisons are more reasonable. And then the midpoint of that is actually a decline on the year-over-year basis. So are there particular products you're seeing more of a slowdown in the year-over-year basis?
Okay. And Kurt, if we look at the wireless weakness last year, I think some of that was related to China and their ramping 4G in the mix of products there. The -- what are we seeing in terms of China this year as they expand their 4G network? If you could give us some color, that would be helpful.
Okay. That's helpful. And lastly, as we think about just the steady state and the growth in the data centers and your opportunities there, any thoughts of recalibrating how we should be thinking about OpEx on an annual basis? Also sales and marketing and then also R&D?
Jump right in, Kurt, I guess I was a little bit surprise that you're only guiding for a gross margin increase 20 basis points sequentially coming off of full impact of telecom pricing in the April quarter. What is driving this? Is there any -- is -- are you seeing more aggressive datacom pricing? Are there any mix assumptions that you've baked in that are impacting the margin guide? And can you elaborate a little bit -- I think it was during Eitan's prepared remarks, where you stated that you're seeing some increased competition. Can you elaborate on that?
Is that increased in telecom versus datacom? Is that increased in a certain speed, 100G, 40G, 10G? Is that across ROADMs, WSS? Anywhere that you can point to where it's more exacerbated?
In single mode versus multimode?
Okay. That's helpful. And then can you elaborate a little bit on your 100G business? Can you help us perhaps understand the relative contribution to datacom versus telecom segments? And then could you give us an update on both kind of your product road map for the QSFP28 and also the coherent CFP2? I believe you're shipping samples last quarter and would love to get your thoughts on when we could see volume shipments of that product.
Okay. And then just last one if I may is can you comment on how we should think about datacom versus telecom in the July quarter relative to the flat -- flattish sequential overall revenue guide?
Just back to this question of datacom competition, I mean, obviously Innolight filed today and they're obviously growing very fast in the datacom space.

Okay. Last one then I'll pass. WSS module, that strength, is that financially [ph] the green shoots of the metro deployments of 100 Gb or just seasonality? Or just any kind of -- is it long haul versus metro? Just any kind of color on the WSS strength and whether or not you expect that to kind of continue to the year would be very helpful.
My first question is just if I try to quantify the impact of the extra week offset by Chinese New Year. I think in the past, Kurt, you've mentioned that, that would be approximately low-double-digit million [ph] positive impact. Is that the right way to think about it? Where your $320 million have been essentially flat quarter-over-quarter somewhere in the 306, 308 number? And would this quarter's midpoint be up about 3%? Is that the right way to think about it?
Sure. And was telco a little bit better and datacom a little bit lower than expected if you look at sort of how April played out?
Understood. And on the higher competition comment, I know you mentioned that as both single mode and multimode. Is it at the higher speed as well as 40, 100? Is it sort of across-the-board on speed? Is it more 10 Gb and wireless? Can you give us some sense of where that higher competition is?
Okay. Understood. And then final question on web scale, can you talk about web scale players as a percent of revenue sort of where they're trending to? And with the talk about 25 Gb servers, 100 Gb in the data center, do you -- when do you think that starts to become sort of a demand driver? It seems like aggregation speeds in the data center today are still mostly at 40 and 100 Gb in the data center. When do you start to think of that as a real revenue driver?
And so if I look at this quarter up, kind of low-single-digit percent quarter-over-quarter, if you x out the timing issues, do you expect sort of that trend line to continue, Jerry, given 100 Gb opportunity going into the second half of the year?
Quick one for Eitan and then one follow-up for Jerry. But Eitan, given we saw some growth in WSS and tunables, I'd just like to gauge your confidence of a telco metro-optical cycle starting, whether it's beginning of next year with a little bit of build in the second half, but just your conviction on this now versus 3 months ago.
Just one follow-up for Jerry then. On the datacom business, I'd be curious to know like how good is the visibility there? If you can kind of comment on [indiscernible] forecast, or is the book-to-bill been above 1 recently? Anything you can help us out with visibility would be great.
I want to go back to the data center, which I know has gotten a lot of attention. But just the comment on the 25 Gb happening, I wanted to verify that that's your second half, but the calendar '16. And then could you just give us a little bit more detail, have all the major hyperscale guys standardized on 40? Or do you think that some of the lumpiness is the decision that's waiting for -- to build out the 25 Gb versus the 40 Gb roll out?
So the [indiscernible] that's timing issue? Or it's not an architecture decision?
Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess, Kurt, I was just curious. If you look at the mix, and I know there's some variability here and you talked about building out the second 2 floors in China, what kind of -- what's the plus and the minuses we could expect in gross margin going out for the year? What would be your best case scenario if you got some operating leverage or gross margin leverage on some volume through the China facility at the end of fiscal '16?
Just wondering, you guys indicated that wireless competition -- or competition for your wireless products was picking up a little bit. And I know that those products were -- have historically been kind of lower-margin products. So just kind of wondering, at what point do you decide to walk away from that business in wireless? Are you anywhere near that decision? And then how aggressive can you be in terms of pricing in that product line?
Okay. And then kind of get -- stay on this gross margin topic, what would it take to get gross margins up to, say, the 32% or 33% range? I know you don't want to give a time frame. But I mean, can you get there based on simply volume? Do you need all these -- execution of all these cost improvements in wireless and optical engine and other products to get there? Do we need a relief of the competitive dynamics? I mean, what are going to be the big catalysts here or could be?
Yes, I understand that. But just kind of -- is it possible to rate the factors -- or rank the factors that could potentially improve the gross margins, let's say, 32% or 33%?
Okay. And final question, are there any products that are in the horizon that you're going to introduce? I know you guys talked about all the R&D to drive new product development. Is there anything on the horizon that you feel like could give you some more favorable pricing dynamics?
This is
in for Simon. I wanted to ask a little bit about operating expenses. I understand the OpEx next quarter will have these exceptional expenses from sales conference and the restricted stock units. But how do we think about OpEx on a normalized basis going forward?
Okay. That's helpful. I wanted to ask you, how do you guys -- what are you guys thinking about the 100G market for intra data center optics? And kind of your timing for how long it takes to develop in terms of timing and ramp PS [ph]?
Yes, right, right.
When are you expecting to introduce the form factors at the CLR4 or the PSM4? Is that the same time frame?
Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And regarding the competitive piece, I just wanted to dig just a little bit more there. I guess, do you consider your key competitors inside the data center, is it still Oclaro, JDSU? Is Avago still one of the guys that you see when you talk about that space also?
Okay. So it's primarily in the Web 2.0 space then, okay.
And lastly, I just wanted to see if I could get a sense of your view around acquisitions. Maybe not any specific acquisitions, although I think some people have one in mind specifically. But just kind of trying to get a sense of your priorities, your logical priorities regarding the consolidation sector in general and your thoughts on consolidation.
Couple for me. First of all, I think you referenced gross margins doing a little better than expected due to their yields in the optical engine. Wondering how good those are compared to overall corporate averages and where you think that can go. And really, where can the volumes go? And can we see a positive mix shift from that quarter or 2 down the road?
Okay. And this is a product that we're seeing from just single customer, or are there more than one? Or do you expect more than one here in the future?
Okay. Is there any time frame by which this becomes a meaningful product category for you like a year out as an example? Any clarity you can give for this -- on that, Jerry?
Okay. Appreciate the detail there, Jerry. One follow-on question here on the topic of CFP2 coherent. How would you play out the competitive environment here? Where do you think your share will sit or your share rank? Any general thoughts as we look out couple quarters a year or so? How should we view that?
Okay. Eitan, how important is it to have a 200 Gb versus just 100 Gb for that product category?
So I'm a little confused about exactly what's going on in Wuxi. Just wondering if you could give us a little bit more clarity around it. It sounds like on the one hand, you have a little bit less CapEx in the quarter that just occurred, that you are accelerating CapEx spend for the upcoming quarter a little bit above what you had expected before. Is that a function of you changing the rate of which you're building those new rooms out and therefore choosing to also the pattern of the spend in order to facilitate that? Or is that going to cause -- are you behind schedule or on schedule relative to the original time line for the build completion that you originally scheduled for the end of April? And relative to that extra capacity, is that a reflection -- should we read into it a reflection of faster transition out of Shanghai and into this building? Where are we in actually shutting down the Shanghai side of it? But could you give us some of the pings and pongs on that? It's kind of hard for us externally to track it?
Okay. So just so I understand, the costs associated with this transition, we've been carrying around a lot of cost for training, busing people back and forth between the various facilities. I assume that, that some of these costs that you've been carrying start to fall out as you bring up the capacity over the next couple of quarters. Is that the right way to think about it? And isn't your cost structure substantially lower here than it is in Shanghai? Therefore, shouldn't those 2 factors help you deliver improvement in margins as we go over the next 2 or 3 quarters, other things being equal?
Is it fair to say that a good part of the pressure in your margins over the last 18 months has been the result of some of this transitionary pressure and as this falls out, you should get some of that margin back that you've given up? Or is that too naïve and it's really a function of product and volumes and you actually have had competitive pressures that are altering the equation? And I guess at the end of the day, are you guys more or less or just about the same in terms of how bullish you are about your business? It sounds really muddled to us from the comments. You don't want to seem to want to commit to any meaningful trajectory on change on anything, whether it's product lines or growth or cost structure. Why so muddled?
That was very helpful. It just helps to get the sense of whether you guys are bullish or nervous.","First off, I'm sorry to hear Eitan's leaving. But it does beg the obvious question which is, can you give us any color on what the reason for the departure is? And does it have any implications for any of the major programs that were under his umbrella? Most notably, the ACO 100G Coherent project? Or any of the other new product development programs?
Jerry, the expectation for the back half of the year has been plotted for a while. This isn't really a new piece of information in the sense that most people knew that there was increasing competition at the low end and the low-end market was being retained longer as a result of the push out of the 25G cycle. There's obviously a lot of new products in startup mode, which you have a lot of prototyping cost for. You've got the Wuxi plant ramping. So a lot of turbulence through the back half of calendar '15. But your commentary suggests that, that pressure is going to be retained through -- all the way through the end of the fiscal year ending July. And that's a much longer window than I think people who are optimistic on the company's longer-term prospects would have expected, particularly in light of the fact that you're now down 2 years in a row in earnings already. So can you give us a little bit more color on why the length of time is so long? And what is changing in the mix to cause that pressure to last further into CY '16 in prior expectations?
And what about on the competitive front? Has there been any change in your thinking relative to the 10G and quad 10G products in terms of price pressure? Volume pressure? The repackaging of the -- for the data center without the -- with the strip to package, non-hermetic? Any of that piece of it?
One last question, and I'll cede the floor. Could you just give us some indication of what the direction was sequentially on the ROADM products?
I'm just -- Jerry, I just wanted to ask on the competitive environment. We're seeing a lot of competition on the low-end. And I guess the investor worry is that this will replicate itself on the mid-range and also ultimately on the high-end. And as Finisar cuts OpEx to protect profitability, how do you work on the balance of it instead of investing more in R&D, so that you can actually move up the food chain? I just wonder if this is the right time to be actually cutting OpEx instead of actually increasing OpEx?
Jerry, on that point, I mean, it does become an industry of escalation and almost an arms race as people try to gain footholds into their key customers within data centers. So anything else that you might be considering -- the Board might be considering, in terms of looking at this -- reducing this arms race between you and very nimble, smaller and larger and ultra competitors?
Okay, that's helpful. And then lastly, Jerry, any qualitative comments on data center spending overall? Whether things are actually slowing for you as you -- or actually still steady-state on the data center side? There's some discussions of CapEx cuts or adjustments.
I guess maybe to ask Mark's earlier question slightly differently. I guess as you look at the competitive industry dynamics, you did talk about moving through the product development cycle at a faster pace as a key goal. But I'm curious though, does the elevated competitive dynamics increase your desire or view on the need for industry consolidation? And do you believe that economies of scale could be a key differentiator, along with a faster development cycle?
Great. And I guess, just shifting to gross margin, Kurt, it's been consistently above 30% for the last decade, outside of a blip in late 2009. And given that 30% has historically been a floor for the company, should we think about gross margin expansion being a fiscal year '17 event with some new products in 25G and 100G which should possibly impact mix? Or based on kind of the competitive dynamics and Jerry, just touching on a more fragmented telecom and datacom, is there a structural shift that's happening that could actually end up pressuring gross margin below 30%?
Jerry, or I'm sorry, Kurt, I guess maybe just asked slightly differently, I think in the past, when you were -- had a gross margin above 35%, you had consistently communicated to investors that typically 35% is where we kind of end up in any given cycle. Is that still a comment that you would stand by?
Maybe a couple of questions for Kurt here. Can you let us know how big is 40G as a percentage of your datacom business?
1/4 of datacom. Okay, are there any supply constraints at 40G, currently?
Okay, and then just one last question on gross margins for me. Kurt, do you think last year, in the January quarter, gross margins declined 110 basis points sequentially, and that was with 3% sequential revenue growth. So is that something that we should think about for this year, as we're working on our models now? Or is there something unique that clouds such a big kind of step down last year?
Okay, and maybe one last question. On the 10G business that's seen all the pricing erosion, are you matching pricing or are you walking away from any business?
My first question's on the telecom side of the business. It grew sequentially despite 1 less week in the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about what may have driven that sequential strength?
Okay, great, thanks. And then, on the datacom side of the business. I'm wondering if you can just give a little bit more clarity. In the prepared remarks you talked about 40G being strong. But presumably, that and 10G are both seeing the pricing pressure. Kind of on a relative basis, did 40G performed as expected or better?
Okay, great, that's helpful. And then, then maybe a final one, if you can -- can you just directionally give us a sense for, at this point, datacom versus telecom margins, if one is above or below the other?
Just a quick follow up on that 40G comment. Given the end of the quarter on August 2, was -- I understand it's lumpy, but was July appreciably different from June? Or was the 40G momentum pretty steady throughout the fiscal quarter?
How many -- can you guys give us a little more clarity or more commentary, I should say, on the number of customers of 40G? And then, as you think about the potential transition of the switchback to 25G that you're talking about, are all the customers moving in the same pace towards that standard architecture and are your products fit for all of the different, all the big Web 2.0 players?
I just wanted to -- as you -- when you think about that 4x 25, do you think that the architecture is being used by the, your customers for 40G are going to be standard? Or do you think there will be nuances in the different ones that you're going to require perhaps more spending or different approaches in viewing the [indiscernible]
Okay, just a question, it looks like on the GAAP side, I think these are related. There was an acceleration in the duplicate facility costs. Can you tie that into, I guess, the CapEx trends and what we should be thinking about, so where the underlying business is going with the transition in the facilities? And then with the commentary on the 20% OpEx being tied to that, is that a combination of revenues and costs? Or is that -- or what's the weighting of that, as you to get to that 20%? Is it more cost savings than a growth story for 2017?
I do have a handful of questions I wanted to run through. One, I think you alluded to this. But just want to see if we could get a little bit more explicit regarding your exposure to China. There was, I guess, a comment about wireless exposure and I -- I'm sure that some of your products go into China, but the end destination is different. But anything you can offer to help us understand the China exposure?
Great. And then as you're preparing for the 100G products coming off of the availability of 25G ethernet chips for inside the data center, the intradata center, can you talk about where you are in terms of product readiness? Do you have a 25G laser available now? Or do you have timing for when you'll have that available? And your expectations for that ramp?
Great. Earlier on the call, you commented about some delays in metro builds coming into more of the second half of calendar '16. Do you know what the cause of those delays are?
Yes, no, I appreciate that. You're probably at more than arms' length on some of that, so I understand. So you did talk a little bit about your views on the need for consolidation. And I think I ask you this on every opportunity. But just want to get an update on your philosophy as a consolidator. What you're thinking in terms of what you may do, what actions you might take to actually initiate or move along consolidation within your markets?
Great. And one last one for Kurt, I believe. During fiscal '15, prior to the 14-week quarter, you did average expenses of about -- just over $67 million a quarter. And I understood you had some items that elevated the July quarter a bit. But you're guiding October, I believe, roughly flat on OpEx. So I'm just trying to understand, what's really driving the year-over-year increase in operating expenses, given where revenue appears to be trending?
For the current quarter, with the revenue guide with the midpoint flat, should we think about datacom and telecom both being consistent this quarter? Or is one expected to do better than the other?
Got it. And then, when you make these cautious comments about fiscal '16, to me, I'm thinking that the datacom competition and the pricing is probably overall a much more significant factor than the 100G telecom delays you're calling out. So am I thinking about that correctly? Or do you think about it differently than that?
Right. And then the reason -- just as long as we're kind of summarizing everything once again, the reason that datacom will do better in '17. I'm sorry to beat a dead horse, but this will be my last question. Just, if you can wrap that up in a bow again, Kurt, that would be great.
So I heard your comments on CFP being down. I presume that's the legacy CFP and not CFP2? I'm just wondering, can you comment, the mix of CFP2 versus CFP? And I guess, since you gave us 40G contribution, I'd be curious where the 100G contribution is, in terms of your datacom percent of revenue?
Great. And just relatedly here...
Overall, thank you. And then just related beyond the QSFP28 100G. Like -- my suspicion here is this is probably going to be meaningful middle of next year. Any -- I'm just curious, you comment on the timing when you think 100G QSFP28 might meaningful for you.
Okay, thanks. And then one quick follow-up. CFP2, ECO any sense for what the kind of revenue opportunity there is on an annual basis? And I know it's -- I'm sure it's pretty cloudy. But just trying to figure how to model that, if it's going to be tens of millions a quarter? Like, what do you think?
Jerry, I was just wondering, given the pricing pressure that you're seeing on the data center side. I believe you've talked in the past about a new, lower-cost version of maybe a 100G product. Do I have that right? Are you coming out with a lower-cost product there to compete with the Chinese? What's the timeframe of that?
Okay. And I mean, as we think about industry consolidation or have thought about industry consolidation, have you seen any interest coming out of China to be active participants, as consolidators at all? Have you seen any of that?
Okay. And final question, kind of piggybacking off a question asked earlier in the Q&A session, but the talk about cutting down on R&D spend a little bit and whatnot. Do you need to cut back on any product lines or become less vertically integrated? I mean, is that -- does that run through your discussions at all? Or do you still see it as being a tremendous advantage to be fully vertically integrated?
A couple of quick ones for me. First, on the cost reduction plan. You guys aren't providing kind of a dollar amount on the cost reduction there. And we sort of have to work with the percentages of revenue as you guided kind of 20-ish percent targets in the first half of '17 off of 21.4% this current quarter. So the revenue base is sort of a moving target. So you are guiding for flat look revenue next quarter. Am I crazy to assume this could be a flat year for you, fiscal '16? How do we think about the next couple of quarters in terms of revenue growth?
Okay. And what's sort of the market growth rate you guys are targeting, running your models towards? Is it kind of high single digits? You've been outgrowing the market all along the last couple of years, at least in the datacom side of the segment. Competition is certainly catching up. And what are your thoughts in terms of kind of -- are you going to be market kind of growth rate, type of company? Above that? Below that? And give us some sense of -- around the kind of numbers out there.
Okay, Jerry, I appreciate the honesty there. And lastly, maybe, pardon me being direct here, but you're 70, you're taking over the CEO role. You've been the CEO, then Executive Chairman, back to the CEO seat. Is there a succession plan in place? I mean, kind of walk us through what the thinking might be, I don't know, a year, 5 years. I mean, I don't know what the plan might be. But if there is one, would love to hear more about it.
A couple of quick questions. First, I wonder if you can talk about, to the extent that China and wireless in China in particular was the source of weakness in the quarter, what sort of outlook you have there? Do you expect that, that has stabilized or even rebounded in the context of kind of the overall datacom being flat? And I wonder if you can offer a comment or 2 on demand trends in terms of results and outlook for the storage market as well. And then I have a quick follow-up.
So storage hasn't been causing you any problems, in terms of results or outlook?
Correct?
Great. And then just a quick follow-up. On a question before, I mean, to the extent -- I think what you said is that manufacturing is not really that strategic to what you're doing. I completely agree with that, for whatever that's worth. Although you do -- and you would do it cheaper because you don't have to pay somebody's operating margin, I understand that. But you are spending $30 million, $40 million a quarter, building a building in China. Can you reconcile kind of those two views? And talk about the investment side of this as well as the operating side of it, and whether that's -- in retrospect, whether maybe that was worth doing.","I guess, just jumping right in, I wanted to dig a little bit on the China commentary. Can you discuss a little bit where you're seeing the demand specifically? And then could you also discuss whether you're seeing any sense that China could be adopting ROADM technology longer term?
Great. And I guess, for Kurt. I know typically you don't like to talk about beyond the current quarter guidance. But given it's the holiday season, I thought maybe you'd give us a gift and perhaps comment a little bit about how the April gross margin should trend. We've seen it on 2015 and in 2013 tick up sequentially, despite the annual pricing declines while it was hit pretty hard in 2014. So if you could give us kind of any range of what you think is a reasonable assumption sequentially from the January quarter guide of 30%?
Great. And then just one last big-picture question from me...
Great. And just one more kind of big-picture question is, we did have Avago sell its modules business to Foxconn, exiting September. I'm curious if you could comment on how you think that would impact the competitive landscape for Finisar given that, historically, that's been a very good duopoly for the company?
Jerry, for you, I was wondering if we could spend some time on ROADMs and WSS demand. I guess, it's been a while since we've seen some good growth from that. So could you go over maybe like the form factors that matter right now? And I know, historically, you had some design wins with Cisco and Ciena, just the design activity and competition in the ROADM market.
Great. That's fair. And how about just one on datacom. So the 100G transceiver business, can you just talk about capacity that you have today? Where you guys are at utilization? And how much capacity you plan on having over the next couple of quarters?
Maybe as a follow-up to that on the commentary on the QSFP28. But remind me where we are in terms of general availability? I thought you guys started sampling basically in the past quarter or so. So wondering kind of how much notional amount that represents at this point and the expected ramp from here.
Okay. That's helpful. Maybe looking at the other side of the datacom market, 40-gig and 10-gig in particular. Is it fair to assume or would you characterize kind of the competitive environment as having normalized? Meaning the price reductions that you had been seeing and the price pressure, is that now largely behind you?
Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then one quick question on the telecom side, wondering if you've had any visibility into the price reductions kind of relative to prior cycles? And last quarter, you had commented a little bit on the North American metro launches, I think, particularly with Verizon as having perhaps extended into the second half of the year. Has there been any change in your opinion on the time line of that?
I want to start out with just 2, I think, easy clarifications. The first one, Jerry, you indicated that the -- in your guidance commentary that telecom, you expected to grow and datacom you expected to decline. I just want to verify, that was intended on a sequential basis, is that correct?
Okay. That's what I thought you mentioned, just wanted to double check that. And when you talk about your ROADMs and your wavelength selective switches, those are products that do fit within your telecom reporting segment, correct?
And they are generally margin accretive to your business, is that also correct?
Great. That's it for clarifications. Now on a question. In the past, you've talked about some of the competitors in the data center with low-cost designs, the concept of non-hermetically sealed packaging as an alternative way of building products for some of the web-scale operators. And I think you've talked about the idea of maybe offering comparable products, and you don't want to sell your higher-performance products at those lower prices. Could you update us on your thinking in terms of whether or not you're introducing products in that category of low-cost manufactured, lower spec design-type products, how you're thinking today?
And what's the time line for availability of those new platforms?
And will this be true for all rates, at 10-gig, 40-gig and 100-gig products?
And then just one last one. In terms of 100-gig, it certainly sounds like you're optimistic about the ramp there. I appreciate that one of the factors might be around the availability of some of the chipsets, the Broadcom chipsets. Could you help us understand how that factors into your expectations and what your assumptions are in terms of volume availability of the semiconductors related to 100-gig?
A couple of questions. You mentioned 2 10% customers. Are those the same 2 as last quarter, I guess? Can you comment?
Okay. Well, also last quarter you mentioned a couple of metrics around your 40- and 100-gig business. I believe it was sort of about 10% of overall revenue at 100-gig, 1/4 of the datacom revenue at 40. Might you have any updates on either one of those metrics?
Okay. Great. And then one final question. I wonder if you could talk about kind of the market opportunity that you see and the competitive position within the CFP2 100-gig pluggable market, the ACO-type component, how you feel you're positioned there? And what your expectations are? I imagine that's one of the new product cycles you referred to for fiscal '17.
One question on CapEx, a little bit less than you expected in the quarter, but up again next quarter. Can you balance what's driving the actual spending each quarter to some of the commentary on the lead times and perhaps some product being on allocation. Is there anything specific going on? Is it just timing? And when should the big CapEx be over at this point?
Okay. And then just a question more generally on the data center architecture. Jerry, you made a comment about the opportunity in China with some new big hyperscale or Web 2.0 data centers being built. Are they using the same architecture as the ones that we're seeing in the United States? Is there a Fibre Channel opportunity for your, I guess, traditional business, which you're very strong in? Or are they going straight to Ethernet? Are they skipping 40-gig and going right to a 25-, 50-, 100-gig? What's the strategy there? And how does play out from a architecture perspective?
What I really want to understand is the upside in the telecom business in the quarter. It seems like from the commentary, a lot of it came from 10G WDM. So where exactly in the world are they deploying all this 10G DWDM? And what are they using it for?
Are you seeing that activity more in one region versus another? Or it's fairly broad-based globally?
Okay. And then just finally, on the same topic, just in the sustainability of that. I mean, because it seems fairly unexpected since it was much higher than your guidance last quarter that this kind of came in during the quarter. And I'm just wondering about the sustainability of it in your view versus with being a short-term phenomenon.
Probably have 2 or 3 for me. Maybe starting with the 100-gig Ethernet transceivers because one of the reasons for the upside in the quarter. Can you give us a sense of whether you see that coming from share gains or is this the market growth here? And Jerry, just want to make sure, were you tying the growth of this product line specifically to China or is it more globally driven?
I would assume CFP2 is kind of the mainstream form factor there. Are you selling meaningful amounts of CFP4 yet?
Okay. That's what I figured. A quick question on 40-gig. You said you had obviously a very strong last quarter and came down from there. Seems like we're seeing a very strong move at that speed in the datacom moving towards 100-gig. Do you see 40-gig as a growth category in 2016 and beyond? Or is that going to fall off dramatically?
Okay. That's very helpful. Maybe 2 questions remaining for me. QSFP28, I'm assuming most, if not all, of your sales here -- which are obviously small starting here, but are multimode. As we look out into -- out a few quarters, do you expect that to be dominated still by multimode? Or how do you see your single mode fibre-related products ramping up?
Okay. Fair enough. Just last quick question, your WSSs, can you give us a sense of the breadth of the customer base, especially for the ones related to Flexgrid deployments in the near term and as you see it kind of developing into calendar '16?","Jumping right in, I think gross margin was definitely a positive surprise, especially on the outlook perspective. And I think you talked a little bit about some of the key demand drivers from a mix perspective that are benefiting it. But if we look out longer term, I think you talked about an uptick or a sustainable uptick in gross margin largely being driven by your forthcoming new product ramps in 25-gig portfolio. I'm curious if you can talk a little bit about the timing of that, the timing of QSFP28 hitting the market in volume and just your confidence that you'll be able to drive some margin accretive business over the next several quarters from that 25-gig portfolio.
Kurt, can you wrap any numbers around the gross margin potential of those products?
Okay. And then Jerry, you talked about strength on WSS and the ROADM business currently and being capacity constrained across a number of products. Could you help us understand the relative size of that WSS business and perhaps quantify the amount of capacity that you're planning on expanding at this point?
Great. And then just one last one, if I may is that, Jerry, we're about another quarter removed from that Foxconn transaction. I'm just curious if you could provide any thoughts around implications to Finisar. Could this be an opportunity for you to improve your market position? Or have you seen any changes in the competitive dynamics?
A couple of quick questions. Just following off of Patrick's comment, can you talk a little bit about the 10-gig pricing environment, particularly, relative to Vixel-related short-range optics stuff, which obviously is where that Foxconn event happened. But it's also where you've been seeing a lot of competition from low-grade Chinese competitors otherwise?
Just the question was really around pricing. I mean, it come down pretty hard last year. Has it finally stabilized? Or is it still coming down at that same steep rate?
Oh, good. That's great. The second question is, could you just tell us what the rate of growth was in the ROADM/wave selective switch segment? And when you gave the 30% number, I assume that's both wave selective switches and blades, right?
So what was the rate of growth there?
Good job. And then the last question, just on the sizing issue. If I were to take the CFP2, CFP2, CFP4 and QSFP28 and compare it in size to the 40-gig and CFP older product, 100-gig product, how does the relative scaling of those compare? Because obviously, there's very different growth rates between those two.
CFP2, CFP4 and QSFP28 to 40-gig and CFP, which is the much older 100-gig piece.
But have you crossed over against 40-gig as really the crux of it?
So I don't know if you've commented publicly on ZTE. I guess, I can infer here that you don't have much revenue exposure there, and I don't see much downside from the restrictions that have been imposed. But could there eventually be some upside here given your strong relationship historically with Huawei? And perhaps kind of wondering if that's -- the comments in the Middle East, if that's going to be through Huawei as well?
Okay. And then just quickly on the last quarter here and the decline in datacom, and I recall I think you expected 40-gig to be the big driver of that. I'm just wondering if you can confirm that. Is it mostly 40-gig? Did 10-gig also decline? What really drove that off?
Just a couple of questions. The CapEx number that you gave, the $26 million, could you kind of give us a little bit of color on the -- how much is left to build out the plant? And how much capacity -- or how much CapEx are you using to relieve some of the capacity constraint you're having? Or do those go hand-in-hand and we can't isolate the two right now?
Okay, so this -- okay, but there's an acceleration there at the end after a slow spend so...
So is there additional test -- so I guess, is there -- what's the -- how can we think about the incremental for where there's capacity constraint? And how many quarters do you think it takes? Or how are you addressing the long-term versus short-term capacity constraint issue within your spending plan?
Okay. That's actually -- that's helpful. And then, I guess it's been -- we've touched on it a couple of different ways, but I think if you look at the progression of revenues and margins, it's been fairly tight over the last 5 quarters, in the same range on EPS margins and revenues. When you think about that product mix and the new building, is there a product category that will drive sustainable revenues? Is there an inflection point where you think you can get to a $320 million level and sustain that for a few quarters? Or is it really just a question of timing across a broader portfolio of product?
The first, I just want to talk to you graphically about China as an end market. How large is that maybe in the most recent quarter versus the past few quarters? And then, kind of a question that I guess had been relevant across a number of different companies, but what is your visibility into that region, especially considering there's some products that may be capacity constrained right now?
In China and demands of deployments in China.
Maybe following up on the WSS and kind of ROADM deployments. How do you view your competitive position? Do you see kind of opportunities for share gains or share opportunity in North America and generally your exposure to kind of Verizon, which is the most public of the known kind of metro network builds?
And then one final one. Just on new products, so the QSFP28 and kind of the CFP2 coherent ACO product. I wanted to get your views on competitive differentiation or unique attributes that you believe your product may bring to the market relative to competition.
Just a couple of things I wanted to follow up on. One is sort of both the short and long-term question on the Chinese end market question. First of all, in terms of the quarter you're in right now, your April quarter, did you experience the normal seasonality during the month of February around Chinese New Year? And is it behaving historically normal? Or is the China demand particularly strong in defying your past years of seasonality? And then following up on that in China, what is your expectation for the duration of such healthy spending trends from the Chinese end market?
Okay. And then I wanted to follow up on your position in the North American opportunities around ROADMs and blades. I believe you were in a position where you were getting certifications from the OEMs last time we spoke. Just wanted to get a better sense of what your timeline might be for when you would expect to receive your certifications and start to see more material contributions to your revenue from North American buildouts featuring your ROADM products?
Great. And then just one last one, a little bit more granularity I'm looking for in terms of gross margin drivers. I've made the assumption that as 100-gig increases in the mix, your datacom gross margins are increasing and that WSS and ROADMs increasing in mix drive up the telecom gross margins. So as we make assumptions about mix, each of those segments should see gross margins trending higher through the balance of fiscal '17, is that a fair assumption?
Jerry, for you on the QSFP28, can you let us know if you are shipping all 3 flavors of the product?
Well, specifically PSM4, LR4 and QSFP28 [ph].
Okay, understood. And then, in the QSFP28 market, do you feel like it's crowded? And as I just think back when 10G and 4 by 10 took off, it seems like you and Avago [indiscernible]. Do you have any concerns that there's just kind of more competition here at the front end of this 100G datacom cycle?
One last one for Kurt. Just when you look at the April quarter guidance, are you expecting both datacom and telco to grow sequentially? Or is telco going to be significantly stronger?
with Northland Capital Markets.
And I apologize in advance for looks like a little background noise here. Have a couple of questions really following on that competition question on 100-gig QSFP. I wonder as you kind of looked at where price points appear to be shaking out early on, are they trying to come in line with what you would have expected? And what would support the notion of maintenance or even expansion of gross margins? So question 1, QSFP pricing. And then somewhat related on the growth side, and you talked about that as a major growth driver so that your peers are seeing double-digit type growth and some cases much greater than that. Your guidance still calls for a year-over-year decline. I wonder if you could sort of take us through the metrics in terms of kind of newer products versus legacy in terms of what's going to kind of tilt the balance for Finisar to be able to grow, I think, forward on the year-on-year basis? And I'll leave it there.
No, overall growth for the company. I mean, midrange, you're still talking about sort of a 1% decline. And I thought you were getting ready to give us some growth expectations for fiscal '17? Or maybe you did and I missed them, but feel free if you would like to. But I'm just trying to understand the dynamics between what is some growth in new products versus declines in legacy products. And what sort of growth rate that kind of might sort out to if a growth rate at all?
Okay. If I could do maybe one quick follow-up. And I think heading forward and interested in trying to bracket expectations for that growth because there's obviously a wide range of -- that could imply a lot of different things. Can you comment on your expected share in 100-gig datacom transceivers versus where you think you are in 40?
So first, I wanted to understand your expectations for 40-gig for calendar '16. I mean, how do you see the growth trajectory of 40-gig in calendar '16? I mean, do you think -- can you still see growth maybe from some of the Asian customers? Or do you anticipate 40-gig falling off a cliff as we move to 100-gig?
One last question for me. It's something that's happened in the industry in the past. Certainly, things have changed over the last 5 years and so. But we're starting to get questions from investors getting concerned about double ordering. So I want to get your take as far as whether that's -- whether things are different this time for -- whether investors should now be as concerned since we're using VMI, something that wasn't there in the past. So if you can provide some context on that, I'd really appreciate it.
Okay, just a quick follow-up with that. You and many other peers in the space are talking in terms of being capacity constrained. So would you think that your customers are getting close to engaging in that type of behavior at this stage?
Kurt, can I get the depreciation and amortization number first?
And then on regarding your outlook, you expect datacom to be up. Should we expect, obviously, 100G will be up, should we expect 10G and 40G to be what, flat to down a little bit? And then 100G, more than offset the decline?
Got it. All right. And then any kind of revenue you left on the table because of the component bottleneck, if any?
And then so you said WSS was up 25% sequentially. What was year-over-year growth?
Okay. If that is the case, WSS, up 25%. Obviously, something was a drag. Which telecom products were a drag on growth last quarter?
I have a couple of questions. More on the channel vertical specific kind of focus on the -- in China, the wireless transceiver business. If you guys could comment where you are on that trajectory of exiting that business. Have you exited completely? Is there some revenue still? And if so, when does that sort of gets out of the model completely? And then also from web scale perspective on the Web 2.0 in that channel, what are you seeing out there demand-wise? Is it healthy as it can be? Do you see some pockets of weakness from that channel? Just kind of a broader, kind of look into the web scale guys and what they're doing out there as far as demand goes?
Jerry, I just want to ask if we're talking about the CPRI transceiver business for a wireless deployment, not the telco buildout?
Okay, got it.
The Web 2.0 demand.
And you guys mind separating that a bit and telling us what exactly -- how much revenue is flowing through that channel versus maybe your enterprise business, which I would venture to say probably fill a fair majority of the datacom revenue you get?
Okay. And can I ask again on the wireless side what percentage of the business? I know it's opportunistic sale from hereon, but what how do we think? Is it...
However you like to define it as, datacom overall.
But do you expect that number to decline as for...
Okay, great. All right, and that's very helpful. And if I may, maybe one last question, and this is getting more on the technical, I guess, side of things. As you look into the telecom market, there seem to be new products coming off your conveyor belt or manufacturing belt if you will. The ACO is one of them. It is also seen to be a quite competitive market with some new competitors announcing products as of late. There are some folks calling out kind of low cost options that may have not penetrate the market initially but, over the long haul, may benefit from their single-chip transmitters solution, et cetera. So I'd like to get your perspective there. Your 2-chip solution today is the modulators potentially either they're internally sourced or you're buying them externally. How are you approaching this ACO market on the telecom side of things? And I also ask that in context of maybe Ciena want to be -- well, potentially want to be our customers on the telecom side onboarding or buying some of the component companies like [indiscernible] and bringing some of that component capability in-house on the telecom side. I'd love to get your view there of what you think of that acquisition and how that may impact the overall space.
And please excuse my voice. I'm under the weather here today. So I'm just going to ask one question, which is revenue timing expectations on CFP2 ACO. When do you expect to have your initial revenues? Is that going to be off of the pilot line which we would then expect a couple of quarters later that it would start to ramp towards volume? Just an update on the timing there, please.","I guess, first, just a multipart question on ROADMs. Could you help us understand the update? Or update us on the status of the Verizon qualification. It would seem from your guidance that you're anticipating that the qualification will be completed in the current quarter and you will ship revenue. And then could also comment on what's causing the delays in some of the adding of your WSS capacity?
And Jerry, any concerns at all that the delaying qualification with Verizon could impact your market share?
Okay. And then I guess on the 40G side -- or I guess, on data centers, I think there was an expectation that the CFP product family would be very strong, but I was a little bit surprised by the 40G growth. So could you isolate the intra-data center part of your single-mode product portfolio and help us understand your thoughts on when 40G growth will turn to decline or on the duration of the contract.
Great. And just on the gross margin side, Kurt, you've consistently talked about mix being most important driver. Could you help us understand how to think about the gross margin potential in FY '17, especially given that in your prepared remarks, you talked about a significant number of new products coming to market?
I've been switched firms. A couple of questions. First, can you talk a little bit about the rate of change in the 100G product line? Just how rapidly it's growing quarter-to-quarter or ideally year-over-year as well, if you could adjust for the 14- to 13-week compare.
Great. And within the telecom piece, can you give us a little bit of more granularity on what individual pieces did? What was the -- how much was the pressure quarter-to-quarter on ROADMs? Was it down 5%, 10%, 15%?
So it sounds like the non -- the legacy products had to -- have been down a lot then. I mean, you're talking about very steep declines there.
So are we talking like 30% type declines there?
All right. Can you also give us a little bit more update on the ACO product, a little bit more granularity on what you've done relative to getting sample units out, where you are in terms of ramping that product line? You said -- you made some comments about it being accretive to growth going out in the upcoming quarter. Any sense of magnitudes around those?
So just so I can get some clarity on what we're saying here, it's -- these are production -- these are nonproduction-line products. These are coming off of the prototype line, I would assume. And we're not yet at the point where we've moved to any production-type line at this point.
And I think I know the answer to this, but generally speaking, the pricing should be fairly stable from April quarter forward for the rest of the year, calendar year?
In general.
Talking in general.
Kurt, can you give us any color on Web 2.0 customers? Maybe what percentage of your datacom business representing the total sales comes from Web 2.0?
Okay. And for you too, Kurt, any comments on what the book-to-bill would have looked like in the April quarter?
Yes. Did you guys have 2 10% customers last quarter -- in prior quarter?
Okay. And any thoughts on the Huawei subpoena?
Okay. I guess where you are locally. But I mean, any changes in our ordering patterns, any concerns? I mean, there's been concerns about the bookings in China and whether or not they can grow from here. And this chatter on Huawei create any pull-in orders. Or do you think there's any concerns like we saw from ZTE? I know that was a quick fix, but just quick thoughts would be great.
I wanted to ask a capacity question from 2 fronts. One is if -- on the CapEx guidance, how much of those facility and how much those new capacity and how should we think about that ramping through the fiscal year? And then I know it's early and you talked about price stability in telecom for the rest of the year. But given you and your competitors talking about capacity constraints, especially in new products for telecom, is there any thought that next year's price negotiations and reductions will be mitigated or lower than this year? Or is it just too early for that?
Okay, that's helpful. And then just, I guess, longer term or maybe not even longer term, but if you -- as you look at the -- inside the data center and you think about the landscape there, could you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape? This should be a year with 25, 50, 100 interconnect to start to take off in the Ethernet side. A good percentage of that probably goes up to both towards the end of the year. And I'm just wondering how you guys see yourself positioned. And then any comments about the adapter card guys you're working with given the Cavium's acquisition of QLogic and what's going on at that level in the data center.
So you don't -- do you see more competition? Are you guys trying to integrate optics? Because Intel's been talking about it. Other companies have been talking about it. Is that impacting anything you're seeing in terms of pricing or competition?
First, I just wanted to follow up on some comments you've made on the ROADM WSS sales in the past. I think you indicated last quarter that the revenue for those products was in the neighborhood of $25 million. And I recall some suggestions that maybe you would exit the calendar year around $35 million for those products. I just wanted to double check your thoughts on that baseline and the trajectory for the WSS ROADM growth.
And in terms of kind of these longer-term gross margin trends, I think you said your typical range is from 30% to 35%, and we're coming from the low point and improving. And I want to get an understanding from you, how you see the industry dynamic, how have things changed in the current cycle or maybe the secular trends where it seems as if on one side, you've got headwinds from some lower cost upstarts, private companies that are talking about very aggressive pricing inside the data center. Maybe that's a headwind. On the positive side, it sounds like there's a lot of capacity constraints in the industry and very significant unit demand. So how do you think about the longer-term trend for Finisar as well as the industry in terms of gross margin and your ability to get back to the high end of your typical range?
So maybe to set the bar just a little bit lower, do you see it as reasonable to model a trajectory over, let's say, the next 2 fiscal years of achieving the midpoint of your historic range?
I realize that and appreciate it. Just wanted to get your perspective. Certainly, I appreciate you taking my questions.
I guess I just want to clarify quickly again on the comment that you think WSS will recover in the coming quarter or grow in the coming quarter. Where do you expect the bulk of that growth to come from? Is that in North American vendors? Do you assume that you do get qualified in North America when you say that? Or is that driven by China? Just any kind of -- or the Chinese vendors to other regions. What's driving that comment?
Okay. To quality -- or sorry, to clarify, I mean, so what you're saying is your guidance for WSS is to be up sequentially, does not rely on the qualification that [indiscernible]?
Okay. That's helpful. So I know, Kurt, you don't want to answer a lot of questions about revenue breakouts, but I'll try this anyway. I mean, QSFP28 versus CFP and CFP2, just curious if you could provide some update on the mix there, and maybe a revenue number for QSFP28 would be great.
That's a lot of detail. I appreciate that. Just one quick though, on CFP2 versus CFP, could you tell me which one is -- the CFP2 bigger than CFP yet?
My first one is a follow-on to the ROADM discussion, kind of pulling it all together. I understand you're building out additional capacity right now for the demand, and that's kind of before the Verizon opportunity. Given the fact that you're still capacity-constrained at these levels, will you have capacity online in time for when those project deployments theoretically begin? Or will you have to continue adding from here? And might capacity continue to be a limiting factor?
Okay. And then more broadly on the telecom side, I mean, investors -- and we would agree that we're entering kind of this multi-year cycle, and yet revenues in the quarter on the telecom business came in at the second lowest level that they've been since you started breaking it out. Is there something that needs to change in terms of industry structure or pricing dynamics to get that business back to prior peak levels or close to the $100 million range?
Okay, that's helpful. And then you mentioned -- and my final question was on the 10G legacy side. Was that geographically specific? Or were there any kind of particular end markets or geographies that you'd point to where you saw the weakness?
Yes, yes.
Okay. Well, just out of curiosity, was that a North American customer or international?
I wanted to follow up on some of the dynamics in the quarter in terms of revenues. Assuming you had pretty good visibility to the impact of pricing declines heading into the quarter and you did guide telecom revenues up heading out in the last quarter, I imagine that, that was a sort of surprise in the downside. And I'm just trying to get sort of what the X factor was on the datacom side to kind of plug that hole. So it sounds like you were -- from my perspective, it looks like 100G had a nice growth as expected. It sounded like 40G might have been the surprise to the upside that kind of allowed you to report kind of around in line. Would that be an accurate [indiscernible]?
Right. And then -- and just to follow up, kind of digging into that 100G, I would have imagined that, that was the source of the upside given the QSFP28 ramp. It's again sort of in line with what I might have expected and what you probably expected. And that occurs in light of at least some commentary around chip availability, chipset availability maybe constraining some of your peers or competitors' ability to ramp QSFP28. It doesn't sound like you're seeing that, but I wonder if you could offer a comment on any constraints outside of Finisar that might be weighing on your ability to ramp QSFP28.
Maybe my first will be on 100G CFP. Would -- how would you characterize the geographic demand for that here? And would you characterize your past quarter here as one showing some share gains for you relative to competition?
Okay, that's fair enough. I appreciate the detail there, Jerry. A question on 100G QSFP28. Based on a response from the last question, talking about roughly $5 million or so in the last quarter and you expected double to roughly $10 million. While an impressive growth here...
More than double. I'll use $10 million as a proxy. I hope you don't mind that. But just thinking about that number, obviously nice growth and a meaningful number for you, but based on the scale that's expected in the industry, still a long ways away from where you possibly could go. Do you see RFPs and RFQs out there from customers that are shorter term in nature? Or do you see someone out there that are possibly getting to some very large numbers over a multi-quarter period of time?
Okay. And to follow up on that topic, Jerry, what do you -- how do you view your pricing in that space relative to what some of the more price-aggressive ones have been talking about? There's a lot of speculation going around OFC a few months ago. How would you characterize where you're at? And where could this go in a year? I think kind of the bogey that some people are talking about is getting down to $500, somewhere between where PSM4 and CWDM4 might be. Where would you speculate the time frame to reach those kinds of levels?
First question is, I don't know whether you talked about this but regarding the price, telecom price negotiations, was it worse than expected?
Got it. And then you gave the datacom mix of 140 and 10, that's about roughly 70% or so. So what's the remaining 30%? Is that wireless piece [ph]?
Got it, all right. And I think you said that CapEx will be $30 million for this current quarter. What was the CapEx for the fiscal fourth quarter?
All right. And my last question is, so what's the mix -- regarding your telecom mix, what's the mix between 10G versus 100G?
Right. I mean, would you classify a ROADM as a 100G product? Or is this -- is it a separate product?","I guess just diving right in on the gross margin side, a very nice surprise there, both the results and guidance. And I think the last quarter, you had said getting back to kind of a 35% level would not happen in the near term. So I'm just curious, what was the biggest surprise with this metric? And do you think that you have the right mix, the right products and the right competitive dynamics that now perhaps a 35% gross margin is realistic in the intermediate term?
Great. And then I guess just shifting to some of the 100G commentaries, specifically on the datacom side. With the QSFP28, can you help us understand the relative revenue contribution? And then any commentary around capacity or the competitive dynamics in that market?
And then just last one for me...
Great. And then just last one if I may is on the ACO. I think you discussed it as contributing to your outlook on the telecom side. Can you help us understand the relative size of that business right now or any type of output?
So I wanted drill down a little bit here on telecom for a minute. So can you tell us how much WSS grew sequentially? And basically, what I'm hearing here is with the telecom strength didn't come from the new line card despite the Verizon deployment. But does your guidance assume that, that line card is ramped and qualified?
That's very helpful. And so just shifting to datacom for a second. I was hoping you'd maybe dimensionalize here the decline in for 40G. I don't think you mentioned 10G. I'm wondering how that is trending. And what are you kind of assuming here for 40G and 10G as you go into this next quarter?
I got a couple of questions. Just going back to quantifying the trajectory of WSS/ROADM products, was it up more or less than the overall telecom? And was it the stronger performing segment? Or was it less than the rest of telco?
That's great. The ACO products, and you talked about where you are in getting qualifications on the DSPs. There are 7 DSPs out there. What have you qualified on?
Going back to the DSPs just for a second. Are those in-house DSPs or are those COTS DSPs?
That's very helpful. And going back to the margin mix, Kurt. You're so far above what most people had been expecting on the gross margins, and therefore the operating margins, that it's a pretty big perturbation to the model. And clearly, at any point in time, you could bring back in some of the wireless stuff. But if we assume that no wireless comes back, and it just stays at this level in wireless, is there anything that would suggest your margin should regress? Or should we, in fact, be thinking that this is kind of a new normal level here and we got to be using that going forward with the potential that there could be a spike in wireless in any given quarter and given the lumpiness of it? I'm trying to be as general as possible, but get some sense of whether this is the new norm.
And one last question, I'll cede the floor. There was a lot of discussion about the Web 2.0 adoption, the 25-gig, 50-gig, 100-gig architecture starting in 3Q. But it looks like that slowed a little bit because of the lack of availability of Intel NIC cards. If that's the case, should we be thinking that the 10 gig, 40 gig is going to take a little longer before it starts to roll over? Or is that inconsistent with your viewpoint? How do we think about the mechanics around those 2 pieces?
Okay. One last question. I forgot to ask this before. The Intel announcements of their silicon photonics with the Indian phosphide right on the silicon substrate, any thoughts on -- whether that's interesting or competitive? And how it might impact you? And then I'll cede the floor.
So any impact?
Quick question within the datacom, 2 parts here. How much of the business is 40G right now, or 40 and 10G? If you could help us out, that'd be great.
Perfect. And then on the QSFP28, can you just help us out with the bulk of the flavors that's driving the revenues right now, is it the CWDM, the SR4s or [indiscernible]?
And Jerry, just last one for you. It's probably a month or 2 before we start the annual negotiations for the pricing. Just curious if you have any thoughts on kind of what the pricing environment would look like with the supply shortages?
Yes, they're all saying the same thing. So hopefully that plays out for them.
A couple of things I wanted to dive into. One, I want to go back to the gross margin discussion. Historically, I've had the impression that the datacom gross margin was typically 2 or 3 points above your corporate average and telecom may be typically 5 or 6 below. And obviously, with the step-up this quarter, I just want to understand if there is some kind of -- first of all, if my assumptions have been valid, and second is how that might be changing. I presume products like WSS are very helpful to the telecom. So any color you can give us on how to think about gross margin by segment?
Great. Appreciate that. And you mentioned earlier some strength from the Web 2.0 or web-scale customers. I think in the past, you've talked about it bouncing around 10% to 15% of revenue. How did that group of customers fare this quarter?
Great. Appreciate that. And then I just wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about your current views on China as a market and both the 100-gig duration in the metro builds. And then you've talked in the past about adoption of switch architectures and WSS/ROADM opportunities. Love to hear an update as to what you see as the time line for the operators in China for deployment as well as how you would quantify the opportunities specifically for Finisar.
I wanted to follow up on the last question with China. Because it's my impression that right now, you're probably benefiting a lot from 10G in China. And I thought that with 100G in China that they were looking for dual rate CFPs, and I didn't think that you sold those. And obviously you don't sell the discrete components. So I just wanted to -- whether my impression is right. But also just going forward for your greater participation in China, is it WSS that we should primarily focus on? Or are there other products over the next 1 to 2 years that you could get into China for the first time including possibly CFP2 ACO?
Okay. That's super helpful. And then my only other question is just on the guide for the sequential 7% growth at the midpoint. Shall we equally distribute that between datacom and telecom? Or do you think one will grow more than the other?
And actually, just to go back to the last question, just speaking about China, appreciate that answer. But on -- just what's going on with 10G in China and things like SFPs and SFP+? Is there still very strong demand there? And is that going to go away as there's even more 100G into China? Or do you think 10G telecom will stick around in China for a long time?
Great. It's a great thing everybody in the industry are doing so well.
I was wondering if you could go into some of the comments on supply constraint and the comments you made on pricing and keeping things under control. Could you just go into some -- where you think you've got -- where your supply constraint is versus the other players in the industry? Is everybody constrained at the same level? And does your CapEx Q2, perhaps components where you've got a considerable advantage and unlocking some of that capacity constraint will lead to even better margins?
Any color you could give us on the couple of places for you to stay -- at a broad level, that's great. Are there any specifics you could give us where you think you're going to make a bigger investment in some of the competition and your -- or where you would be pulling back?
Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess, I know we've talked about gross margin in different formats during the Q&A. But I'm wondering, if you go forward and you think about getting back to a higher gross margin level, how much of this quarter or how much of the move from 31% to 34% is a mix question? How much is capacity? So -- or how much more can you squeeze out on those 2 different vectors?
A couple of questions. Vis-à-vis that broad rebound in telecom that you mentioned, will you be able to isolate that regionally to being more weighted to China or North America, I mean, as most of that potential upside came from China? Can we say that? Or was it broad-based, spread broad-based across all the regions?
Okay. All right. And one other thing is I think last quarter that was a bit of a surprise -- well, it wasn't a surprise really, but just you incurred some issues qualifying the ROADMs, and potentially that's still a North America event at this point in time. But talk a little bit where we are on that qualification. Have we passed qualification issues? Are those behind you now and you're ready to ship this full speed?
Okay. Calendar '17, so that was my sort of follow-up. It's -- you're not really projecting that into your guidance yet for Q2?
Okay. Fair enough. And then lastly, maybe 1 or 2 more questions. One on the Wuxi, China facility. Could you remind us what type of products are being manufactured there? Datacom, telecom, a mix of both worlds, where you are on the ramp-up of these products. Just sort of an overview of that facility there.
All right. Well, great to see that transition had worked to your expectations, or better. And then maybe lastly then. On the 100-gig side and the pricing environment there, it sounds like the margins are holding up quite nicely just yet, and there's obviously a competitive dynamic developing around 100 gig and Web 2.0s and most of the RFPs that are pretty aggressive as far as what they're asked for on a price per gigabit. So can you comment a pretty benign sort of environment at this point in time? And on 100 gig, frankly, what are you expecting going forward?
First regarding CapEx. So first quarter was $30 million. What should we expect for second quarter as well as for fiscal '17?
Got it. And then specifically on WSS, it sounds like you added a little bit more than 10% last quarter. Are you kind of targeting similar capacity expansion this quarter?
Got it. And then on ACO, I just wanted to make sure. I think you talked about maybe shipping a few hundred units in first quarter. And are you still quite confident about shipping meaningful revenue by the end of this year? I guess that will be about fiscal third quarter or maybe fiscal fourth quarter at the latest.
Got it. And just regarding your 2 10% customers, I assume they are same 10% customers as of -- from the fiscal '16. Or were percentage of sales pretty comparable to last year's numbers as well?
They were like around, what, 12%, 13%, something like that in fiscal '16? And just wondering if they were kind of comparable in the first quarter as well.
So most of my questions have been answered. So first, a housekeeping question, though. Did I hear correctly that you expect the tax rate to be between 4% to 5% for the rest of the year?
Okay. And then so on line cards specifically, it sounds like -- based on the question by a gentleman ahead of me, it sounds like you're not expecting line card contribution on your October guide. But I wonder if you can walk us through the process of adding capacity and getting to production on line cards specifically. Is it similar to WSSs where you have to get the production in Wuxi, China, for which you have to hire staff, train staff and also add equipment? If that's the case and you're not qualified, what gives you confidence that we can see some revenues, for example in the January quarter?
I have a couple of questions really about kind of expectations heading into the quarter and how things turned out. I think last quarter, you've indicated expectations for growth on both the datacom and telecom side sequentially. You really didn't see that on the datacom side. I wonder if you could provide any color about kind of why that matter remains flat. And I say this what's on -- an eye on the go-forward guidance where if you do see kind of equal percentage increases, you'd be breaking out of this kind of 240-ish million range the datacom business has been in for a couple of years. And I wonder if you could talk to what the drivers of that might be.
And then as you look forward on the datacom side, it would seem like that you're seeing some nice growth in 100 gig, both QSFP28 and CFP. And at this point, you don't really expect much in the way of a negative offset from 10 and 40 gig and for that to remain flat and maybe for some of that growth to show through on a sequential basis. I don't know if that's right the way to look at it. And -- well, I'll leave it there.
And just to follow up real quickly. Would it be fair to say that 10-gig datacom was also flattish in the quarter that you're just reporting?
It's up a little bit. Okay. So one final question on the CFP2 ACO, I think you guys mentioned expectations for shipping hundreds to shipping several times that. In the current quarter, imagining that, that didn't happen, I wonder if could you comment on whether we're seeing expectations push out a little bit for the CFP2 ACO ramp? Because had you shipped several times, we'd be talking to a few hundred units, we'll be talking about more than $1 million to $2 million. So wondering if you can talk about kind of expectations there on the CFP2 ACO side, whether the timing is maybe a little bit different than you might have thought.","Your main ROADM competitor, I believe, this week said that they already have orders in hand for ROADMs in China for the near term. Do you have any commentary along the same lines you could share?
And will there be revenue from that included in the guidance you just gave?
Okay. Any commentary on sort of how that could ramp into a sort of a full run rate? Or how big or how long-lasting that project can be?
Okay, great. And then just one more for me would be on the annual price negotiations, can you share any color there of what's looking like this year? And should we be -- how much conservatism should we may be put into our April gross margin estimates, if any?
And Kurt, if we're seeing 2 months of that in April, I know you don't give more than 1 quarters of guidance at a time, but would you want us to take that into account? Or are there other factors where we could be flat in April?
So just a couple of things, if you could give us some detail on the actual kind of growth rate in the ROADM/wave selective switch quarter-to-quarter? And can you give us a little bit of a cut at 10-gig SAN in SIPRI?
Yes, if you can just give us a little bit more on what 10-gig did and what SAN did and what SIPRI did?
Is wireless now less than -- like less than $10 million kind of thing kind of trending around very de minimis amount?
Okay. And then SAN?
Going back to Mike's question about the China demand. I think he wasn't asking if ROADMs and wavelength switches were going to go into China -- for sale into China, but rather for use in China, which is a very different question. You've been selling ROADMs into China for years. Obviously, that's not the issue. The question is, are you shipping in the current quarter product for sale into China that would be used in China?
So along the same lines as the prior question on gross margins, as we look out into the April quarters, we've been bucking the trend here with very strong demand, you're seeing extremely robust situation, ramping capacity. Is it feasible to think about another year where we're not down sequentially on the top line in that quarter? I know -- I'm not looking for guidance, just sort of general conceptual thought process there.
I guess, first question to one of you is the status update on qualification for -- at Cisco for your ROADM line card. Also, I'd love as you guys would share what the QSFP28 revenue did sequentially in the quarter?
QSFP28. 100-gig revenue.
And that would happen again next quarter?
Just last one. You guys, it looks like you're joining the 3D sensing party, potentially here. I'm just wondering if you could speak to a little bit about what you think your revenue opportunity would be? I assume you're talking about for mobile device primarily and what do you think the dollar per phone could be. And when do you think that could ramp? It sounds like a lot of people will just going to ramp in the second half of next year. I'd just love to hear more on that.
Just a follow-up on James question there on the 3D sensing stuff. Could you answer the question about the dollar content for phone?
Okay, right. How about maybe for -- one more for Jerry here, just an update on the ACO status. Any new certifications, qualifications, yes, during the quarter?
Perfect. And just maybe one for your, Kurt. The story you've talked about 35% being the right gross margin level for this industry and, obviously, near term where we love that now and I think we can grow higher, I'd just like to hear your thoughts longer term about what you think the gross margin profile is for Finisar in this industry?
All right. And you said -- maybe just one follow-up on that. If you think about the 3D sensing opportunity, with the margins, gross margins on that be above corporate average?
Just to ask a little bit more on the CFP2 ACO. Can you help us understand your shipment levels, are we currently in the hundreds of units, several hundreds of units, just a ballpark there.
Great. And then, I guess, on capacity utilization in Wuxi. Can you help us understand where you stand there? And from a footprint perspective, should we expect any major facility expansions for Finisar?
Okay. And then on the QSFP28, can you give us a little more color on which variance are seeing the most demand or order, and then also the pricing dynamics within those products.
Great. And just last one, Kurt, on G&A, that's down nicely in the quarter. I believe you have some legal costs that rolled off, correct me if I'm wrong there. And how should we think about the -- just the level of G&A on a go-forward basis?
First one is on the datacom side. Can you give us a sense of how big 100 gig is now as a percentage of datacom? And then question on 3D sensing, I'm curious about kind of the generation of getting into that businesses. This is kind of the first time that we're hearing about you proactively going after it and adding capacity. Is this something, though, that you've been developing or working on or talking to customers or potential customers for a period of time? Or is this a recent shift in strategy?
Probably that was helpful. Then my question also on 100 gig as a percentage of datacom and then I wanted to have a follow-up.
Okay, perfect. And then finally one is related to the SAN business, but obviously a fairly large customer being acquired by someone that you could consider a competitor or alternative source. Can we get your early thoughts on what that impact maybe? And if there are any lessons to kind of gleam from the Emulex days?
I appreciate the detail. And maybe just to follow up on that, final one for me, how large is the SAN exposure at this point for the datacom business just so you can kind of help frame that.
I want to shift the discussion a little bit on service side optics, And with the Tomahawk pushing cloud operators to 25-gig and then 50-gig rates, do you foresee copper still being used in that environment? In my imagination sort of tells me maybe at 100 gig, you will have to almost go to fiber, but potentially fiber could adjust to 25-gig, 50-gig level as well. So as you go into that rack-server level optics environment, how is Finisar positioned for that opportunity? What's the timing? And how you're thinking about the TAM? I supposed that the opportunity for you in that kind of market shift is opening up?
A couple of things. One, I'm going to go back to a question I've asked you in the past to get an update if exposure you've had direct sales to web scale, how that may have moved around in this particular quarter?
Great. And in terms of the ROADM opportunity in China, specifically the deployment by Chinese carriers, we've heard some mix commentary about their choices of architecture, whether they would look at a legacy-type architecture and a low-count 1x9, or whether these operators would adopt something similar to the western vendors, maybe one by 20 with the CDC. It sounds like maybe there's some mix. I'd like to hear your thoughts in 2 parts in terms of what you expect the Chinese operators will deploy in terms of a mix of technologies for ROADMs and then what does that mean to Finisar?
And in terms of the timing on the Chinese operators for the 100-gig opportunity, specifically transceiver opportunities for you, what do you expect in terms of any of the seasonal patterns during the course of the year, the timing of the tenders some of what we've heard is this tends to be back-end loaded because of Chinese New Year and just the time it takes to route, review and assess tender bids. What's your view on the timing for those opportunities in calendar '17?
Maybe I'll start with the 100-gig QSFP question. Can you characterize the growth coming from -- is more of it coming from Web 2.0 direct sales or through OEMs? Can you give us some understanding of that would be great, please.
Both. Okay. How would you characterize your customer base on the web scale side for the QSFP28 products? Is it similar to singular customer or very broad based? Or how would you characterize that shift?
Okay. To that point, Jerry, when do you expect industry constraints to be overcome? Does that have to happen within the quarter or more like a half year? How do you view that?
Okay. And to follow on that topic, how do you expect it to read into the pricing trends? It seems like LR4 is less competitive space there, where we expect price to be better, but how about even on the CWM4 (sic) [CWDM4] format?
That's helpful. One last question for me on 100-gig or CFP2 ACO. You talked about some qualifications and more to come. Jerry, could you take a venture to guess what kind of share you might expect in this market, say, in a year's time? And also fruitfully, you've talked about your products being able to do 100 and 200, do you expect to be able to do 250 at some point in the near future? And how important would that be to do so?
Kurt, what was the CapEx for second quarter?
Okay. So regarding 3D sensing capacity, what's the current capacity? And how much are you planning to add next year?
Okay. And then regarding, Jerry, your comments about 3D sensing gross margin, you said some might be above and some might be below. I thought -- correct me if I'm wrong, but if you're selling chips, should they be nicely above corporate average since they will be similar to like semiconductor gross margin of, say, 50% or so?
Okay. Moving to WSS/ROADM business. What's the current mix? I assume WSS is still much bigger than ROADM at this point. What's the current mix at this point?
I'm assuming when you say qual, you're talking about the North American market. But what about China? Do you think it will be more WSS or ROADMs?
I'm talking about the Chinese network, but that will be going to Chinese networks.
Got it, got it. And then, I guess, you already talked about whether it's CD, CDC, hard to say. But what about the current orders that you have on hand? I mean, can you tell us whether they are CD or CDC at this point?
Got it. And then lastly, in case you're already sampling CFP2-DCO. So is there additional pressure for you and other ACO vendors to introduce CFP4 just to keep up with CFP2-DCO?","Jerry and Kurt, I guess given the stock action post market, the question I'm getting from investors is, how is this different than 2011? You walked us through some of the puts and takes on the lower guidance, I think, focusing on 100G CFP and also walked through some potential growth items through the remainder of this calendar year, but if you could maybe help us allay some fears here, that'd be great.
Great. And then, I guess, on QSFP28 side, Jerry, you said you're sold out, you're adding capacity and you should be sold out through at least calendar 2017. If we look back at Arista just a couple of weeks ago, they talked about optical supply constraint easing as early as this first calendar quarter. Is there any way you could help us maybe square their comments versus what you're seeing?
And just if I can sneak one more in -- thank you for the details on 3D sensing and generating revenue in the quarter, but I think certain -- I think investors in general see Finisar as having less of a market opportunity perhaps than competitors, given the perception of less capacity stemming from foreign VCSEL wafers that may be put you at a disadvantage per -- versus peers. I'm curious, is this perception wrong? And can you comment on whether you have the potential to generate similar levels of revenue that have been alluded to by your competitors?
So I guess, first one to sort of verify something. There's been some chatter about you guys having some product quality or qualification issues on a couple of different LR4 products. I want to clarify whether you've seen any of that. Is that at all creating a lack of offset as CFP rolls off? Can you just kind of clear the air on that issue?
Okay. How are -- in general, as you step back, I mean, how are you thinking about the CFP, CFP2, CFP4 business in aggregate this year? I mean, do we think that -- CFP has probably a higher ASP because of the gearbox and there's been some fluctuations issue in QSFP28 as well for LR4, but as you look at that bucket of CFP datacom modules, I mean, is that going to be a significant headwind in this calendar year?
I guess, to sort of close the loop in the qualification issues that you were talking about, is this temporary? Are you expecting this to be resolved in the next quarter or 2 or some finite period of time?
Maybe just a follow up on the qualification issues. Can you help us size or quantify out of the impact to the fiscal third quarter the fiscal fourth quarter guidance that you're anticipating from kind of these specific issues?
Well, I guess, maybe to address that specifically, what is the revenue impact of those technical issues that you're facing with customers? I mean, is it $5 million, $10 million in the quarter in the guidance?
Okay. Maybe another question on 3D sensing. Can you give us a sense, you've been adding capacity now pretty aggressively for 2 quarters. I mean, how much capacity do you anticipate being online by the second half of the year to service these customers -- or customer or customers? Can you give us a sense on how far down the road you'll be?
Okay, understood. And then maybe one final question, just looking out to next year. I know you just got it for fiscal fourth quarter, but looking into fiscal '18, any sense on if growth rates should accelerate or decelerate after coming out of '17, which is kind of mid-teens growth?
I was hoping you could slice and dice a couple of things a little bit more for us. Talk a little bit about what you're thinking on 10-gig, 40-gig and whether that business is now going to not just flatten out but actually start to roll over on a sequential basis going forward beyond the impact of the pricing. Obviously, to date, we haven't really seen most of the upgrades kick in, in the scale-out data centers because there's been other constraints, but that looks like it's going to resolve itself. So is that going to start to roll over more aggressively?
Can you give us some sense on what's going on in the fiber channel segment in the market in the quarter trading and [indiscernible]?
So seasonal decline on pricing and then just flattish on volume?
One more product area, the SIPRI, and you actually mentioned it in your prepared remarks, the sub-10-gig stuff. I'm assuming that, that's down to very low single-digit kind of revenue levels and that it's not anticipated that, that's going to change in a meaningful way. I was a little surprised to hear it. I thought it was already small enough to have fallen out of the mix. Can you talk about what your plans are there, whether you're going to use any capacity in that space or whether you're going to continue to keep it at very low levels?
One last question, just on the telco side, excluding the ROADM wave selective switch stuff, what was the trajectory of the non-ROADM non-wave selective telco switch business?
Okay. So it was down revenues and volume? Or just down on pricing?
I wanted to focus a little bit on gross margins. I know if you go through historically where margins have peaked, there have been periods where it was -- gross margin grew significantly because of specific product launches and I guess, monopoly types of activity. If you look at what's going on in the -- for the fourth quarter in the guidance, which seems to be pricing and a little bit of mix, how should we think about the opportunities with some of these new products coming out, VCSELs and things like that, and where margins can go from here for the next 12 to 18 months?
Okay. And then just kind of a follow up on some questions that have been with the VCSEL expansion and the CapEx. If you look at that CapEx that you're shipping and there's going to be revenue in the second half, do you -- are you working on one application or are there multiple end markets where -- that are interesting right now to just start with one area and potentially move further along into other consumer electronics sorts of applications? Are you seeing designs for that already?
And how independent -- I mean, if you don't sell all the pieces that would go into a module that would do the 3D sensing, are you just selling independently or are you working with integrators and the other components that go into making these modules work?
A quick follow up on -- James had asked a question, Jerry, about I think these quality issues for the QSFP28 LR4 and I thought your answer was more on CFP. So could you just talk about any issues on the LR4?
Okay. Understood. And just to understand, Jerry, on 3D sensing, I think I heard 2 different answers. Your belief in an inflection in this space, was that at the end of this calendar year '17 or the end of fiscal year '18?
Middle of '17. And would you say that your conviction on that infection happening now is higher than what it was just 3 months ago?
This is Mauricio in for Simon today. Can you guys talk about the ROADM opportunity in China? It looks like your visibility improved, and just wanted to know if you could talk about your expectations from the timing of the deployments, volume wise, and maybe provide some quantifications on the revenue opportunity and the mix. By mix, I mean, the more -- the ROADM select versus the more legacy broadcast select?
Then on the Verizon Metro project, do you now expect obtaining qualification on a major OEM for this 100-gig Metro initiative? And I think you mentioned that the timing was early in fiscal year '18. Did I get that right?
Okay. Then given that the bulk of your ROADM revenues clearly come from sales of WSS and other components employed to make a blade, how should we think in terms of revenue and profit margins once you start obtaining qualifications on these -- on the North American project where -- differently than China. OEMs in North America, they seem to be adopting the entire ROADM blade rather than outsourcing WSS and building their own solution in-house.
So what is the revenue margin profile of filling the entire blade versus just filling the sub-components, WSS and other components?
I guess, just few for me, and I'll start -- probably one for Jerry on 3D sensing. You talked about a big pick up in the second half of the year, and I think from some other answers you gave to previous questions, it sounds like you're having a breadth of customers driving this. Can you characterize that a little bit more? Is that dominated by any particular one or is this more broad? And it's also, if you could maybe lay out the competitive landscape there as you're seeing it right now that would be great to hear.
Okay. And I apologize, Jerry, I may have misspoke it, the essence of my question is basically regarding 3D sensing. So I apologize if I misstated that, but can you lay out kind of the competitive landscape there and the breadth of demand you're seeing in that area?
Okay. Great, that's great to hear, Jerry. The other question on the CFP2 ACO, and I might have missed the entire essence of your prepared remarks there, but if you could clarify how many qualifications you have now, how many you might expect over the next quarter or 2? And then do you have any expectations of what kind of share you might able to generate looking a year out or so? Any perspective there would be great.
Okay, fair enough. My last quick question, for your guidance for the April quarter, can you characterize how much you're expecting from ROADMs, specifically from Verizon and/or from the ACOs?
Question kind of on the historic seasonality on the telecom side and relative growth rates in telecom and datacom. I think last year, you saw quite a -- similar type decline in telecom in Q4 sequentially, maybe with some different drivers, and maybe that's why I had you modeled down overall sequentially for Q4 here heading in. But I wondered -- it looks like even with that decline sequentially in telecom, you're going to be up mid-20s on a year-over-year basis. So wonder if you could compare the 2 kind of sequential declines on the telecom side, the one you saw last year versus this year, obviously, at higher levels. And then that brings the fiscal year in at 20-something percent growth on the telecom side versus low teens, datacom. I wonder if you expect, leaving 3D sensing aside, that kind of mix of growth rates to change as you look forward into fiscal '18.
Okay. So it sounds like your baseline expectations for maybe those growth rates to reverse, if any -- not -- I'm not talking about absolute levels, but to the extent telecom grew faster -- significantly faster than datacom in '17, sounds like you expect that to potentially reverse in '18, subject to some of these kind of qualification, fairly binary issues that you discussed or the various [indiscernible] you said there.
And Kurt, the other question was about Q4 seasonality in telecom this year versus last year. Is there any sort of commentary that you have?
Got it. And final question for me, clearly, as you've noted, your cash balance increased pretty significantly in the quarter due to the convert. I think there is an assumption here that you're looking to do something with that cash over time. I wonder if you can update us with your views on the potential attractiveness of consolidation in the industry and maybe with an eye toward addressing some of the qualification issues on the telecom side that you've been struggling with or really, any other way you want to approach it. How are you thinking about consolidation here now that you've got the convert in the back?
To start with just a clarification, is -- QSFP28, do you have some of it counted in datacom and some of it counted in telecom?
Okay. Because I thought earlier, you talked about CFP as a telecom product in China, so I thought maybe...
Okay, perfect. On the QSFP28, you mentioned being sold out in the hyperscale market. Are you also sold out in the Chinese market as well?
Okay. And then finally for me, I see a lot of positives for fiscal '18 here, but also, we did miss the numbers and the guidance that was just put up. So I was just wondering if you could reconcile -- I mean, I've heard maybe some CFP weakness and some pricing declines. Are there any other reasons -- how would you describe the reasons for the miss?"

Comments,"Thanks, Kurt. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of LightSmyth Technologies of Eugene, Oregon. LightSmyth is a pioneer in the use of semiconductor manufacturing tools to produce differentiated high-performance and cost-effective grating products.


LightSmyth, previously, was a supplier of grating for Finisar's WSS ROADM products. This acquisition further enhanced Finisar's vertical integration strategy. And the acquisition is not expected to be material from an revenue or earnings per share basis.


With respect to new products, we are making excellent progress on the development of our 100G CFP2 coherent module, which we utilized our vertically integrated advanced indium phosphide lasers, modulators and receiver components. We believe we will have an industry-leading product in terms of power consumption and performance for both metro and long-haul coherent applications.


We are continuing to ship qualification samples of our 10G tunable SFP+ to many of our customers. As a result of our next-generation vertically integrated optics, we continue to believe we will have the lowest power consumption module in the industry of approximately 1.5 watts.


Our standard and low-profile dual wavelength selective switches program is progressing very well. Due to our long history of developing innovative LCoS-based devices and WSS products, we are offering our customers a higher level of performance than they can obtain from any other solutions. Our designs are using common platform that can address multiple markets and give our customers the flexibility of buying one product that can be deployed in many different configurations.


While demands for our transceivers that address Wireless applications was very strong in the first quarter, demand of these products is expected to decrease in the second quarter. We expect the demands to return and the revenues to increase sequentially for these products during the third quarter based on continued LTE deployments around the world but especially in China. We have a very broad portfolio of short- and long-reach and various data rate solutions for these important markets.


In datacom, we have production-released our 100G CFP2 LR4 and are seeing a very strong demand for this product. Due to our vertical integration of the lasers and receivers, our module consumed the lowest power amount, the lowest power consumption of any other solution in the market. We are currently adding capacity in order to shorten the lead times and address opportunities to expect -- expand our market share.


In the 40G datacom market, we believe we have the broadest portfolio in the market for both transceivers and active optical cables in the single or multimode configurations. And finally, we have several exciting product announcements and demonstrations scheduled for the ECOC trade show in Cannes, France later this month.


And now, I'll turn the call over to Jerry for some final comments. Jerry?
I think it's all of the things you say. I mean, mix is affecting the gross margin. We continue to take the costs out of the product. The product continues to be competitive in the market too. So we don't expect this to be getting into -- this product to get into the average -- corporate average gross margin. And we actually said that before. This is accretive to our earnings per share, and it's a very little R&D, if no R&D. So basically, the return on invested capital is still where it needs to be. And we are reducing the impact as we go along, but we don't expect it to be in the average or for average gross margin.
I think my comments regarding the gross margin improvement not meeting the mid -- the average corporate gross margin was related to the Wireless business only.
So Joseph, if you look from a product point of view, their gratings are sitting in a majority of our products right now and I would expect them in the next year or 2 to be in all our products. Now, if you look at how they integrate to the rest of the products, it's not only in WSS they're going to help. We see them as a broader -- as a supplier for a much broader product, which is not only WSS.
Please, I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
This is a fab. So basically, when they make their components, it's an ISC type. So the packaging is going to move to China, but the fab itself stays where it is.
So -- your question is about telecom, you mean telecom has been soft for a while but there's a number of products we're developing, which we think have a very -- great growth drivers. So on the WSS side, we continue to develop new products. We have new line cards. It's customer-specific so we can't talk about which one is qualified where, but we can say all our projects are on schedule for qualification. Has demand been what we expected it to be? No, it has been softer than we expected it to be on the line card, but as far as all our new projects, the new line cards meeting their targets on qualification, the answer is -- it's yes. And that means we have the share we expected. As far as new -- exciting opportunities in the telecom side is we have a significant program, which one of them we talked about in this call about the coherent product and we think that represents a significant opportunity for the company and we expect to be the only leader or one of the leaders in this business with our execution on this program. Our tunable XFP is doing great in the market. So if you combine all these opportunities, we think there is a great opportunity. And those parts are used in telecom and datacom together, because in some cases there is no more differentiation. Telecom, datacom, it's just the functionality of the part itself.
Not the line card but when this coherent becomes a pluggable product like the CFP2, which is the product that's supposed to be in the customer's end in alpha mode. But before the end of this calendar year, the answer is yes.","Thanks, Kurt. Our R&D spending in the second quarter was about $45 million, down slightly from Q1. Our projects and technology centers are spread around the world: U.S., China, Australia, Israel and Europe.


We are pleased with our new product development efforts in devices, ICs and modules, and our ability to ramp those new products into production volumes at our manufacturing sites.


At ECOC in September, we demonstrated our next-generation ROADM technology, including our low-profile Dual 1x20 Wavelength Selective Switch and a new high-resolution Optical Channel Monitor.


In Q2, Finisar also demonstrated 100 gigabit QSFP28 Active Optical Cable, the first of several new products in the QSFP28 form factor.


We continue to make excellent progress on our development of our 100 gigabit CFP2 coherent module. Industry analysts forecast 100G coherent transceiver markets to be approximately $400 million in calendar year 2016.


We expect our overall product development to be maintained at a similar level as Q2 so that our R&D investments will be about $46 million for our third quarter.


Now I'll turn the call back to Jerry for some final comments.
In the telecom, I mean, the actual strength of metro is we expect it to be in the mid-2015. So right now, we don't expect significant growth in telecom. We have some new products going into the market on a regular basis. So we see moderate growth, fluctuating with the market. But the significant growth we expect to happen when metro upgrades will be a reality.
Yes, it depends on the timing of the switches. I think a lot of people are talking about deploying I/O, 25 gig I/Os. And our modules are going to be ready between next year to the next 2 years depending on the modules, specifically. But it's -- more of that is driven by the time of deployment of the 25 gig I/Os.
For us, our schedule as we said, I think even in the last call, we said by the end of the year, we're sampling our customers. And by mid-next year, we expect to be in full production. We are dealing with a large number of customers, so we expect this transformation into the pluggable devices to be pretty wide industry and a big opportunity for us. As far as the actual timing and how they ramp, we roughly say it's the second half of next year. But from what we see it's not only new customers who were -- it includes customers who were actually building line cards before and want to transfer to pluggable devices, so the opportunity is pretty sizable.
I think for geographic comments, it's hard to -- for us to see where the demand is because we have customers who are located geographically but they deploy their equipment in other geographies. But we didn't see substantial difference from what was in the last few quarters. So the behavior was not substantially different. I mean, so -- but overall, if you see the softness in the telecom, it came pretty evenly across the geographies.
You mean the 100 gig coherent?
I mean, we look at it as opportunity because if you look at the cost dynamics of 100 gig coherent when it started, it was a very expensive solution. And as more and more are being deployed, the cost effectiveness is coming around the DSP and their optics is becoming the majority of the costs. And our efforts in our pluggable CFP2 coherent is to bring more effectiveness and enable the higher density. And basically, the people who make the DSP let them optimize their business and their core competency, but we supply an optical module to fit everybody's DSP. So we think the opportunity here is to help our customers reduce their costs and help the 100G coherent proliferate much deeper into the network when you enable lower cost and higher efficiency.
Let's see if I remember all your questions. So you're started asking me about silicon photonics. Look, for us, silicon photonics is just another technology. We have many technologies and we don't intend to specify each technology to each product. Are we working on silicon photonics? We have projects on silicon photonics we have demonstrated in ECOC, which we think is one of the most advanced modules in the market for silicon photonics on 2x50 gigahertz -- 2x50 gigabits, sorry. And it was on fully integrated transceiver. But the way we look at it is we will match any application with the most cost-effective and best performance for our customers. Silicon photonics for us is just another technology that we can use. I think the important message here is we have indium phosphide, we have silicon photonics, we don't need to buy anybody, we don't need to have major revamp in our operation to use it. And we'll use them as our products need them.
I don't know what the number is, but I think we still have capacity issues to deliver the market whatever they want to buy and we're still ramping capacity on our products.","Thanks, Kurt. We expect revenues for our fourth quarter will be in the range of $310 million to $330 million. Please note that the fourth quarter fiscal 2015 will have 14 weeks compared to 13 weeks in prior quarter. However, the positive benefit of the revenues for extra week in the quarter will be partially offset by the impact of the Chinese New Year, which occurred in February. We expect non-GAAP gross margins to be approximately 30% primarily due to the impact of full 3 months of the annual telecom price reductions. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to increase primarily due to the extra week relative to the prior quarter. Non-GAAP operating margins are expected to be approximately 8% to 9%. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $0.22 to $0.28 per share. As a reminder, our first quarter of fiscal 2016 will once again have 13 weeks relative to 14 weeks in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. We continue to believe in the long-term growth prospects of the company. Finisar revenue is driven primarily by growth in the worldwide demand for bandwidth with ever-increasing distribution and use of video, images and digital information. In addition, Finisar continues to benefit from growth in cloud services which drive networking hardware upgrades of existing data centers and build-outs of new hyperscale data centers.
And now, with that, I'm going to turn back over the call to Matt to open it up for questions.

Question and Answer
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................
I mean, currently, we -- Subu -- we're investing in the most strategic products that we think is going to have the growth. And obviously in the product that's not going to give us the return investment, we're reducing the level of R&D. So obviously, we have big investments going in coherent and some level of ROADMs and other things and SFP+. So we choose our products and we try to match what we expect from the growth and what we expect the best return to be.
Well, I think if you look at the long term, I'm still hoping that this thing would be coming back to the $100 million level. I can't tell exactly when that happen. It's actually -- it's all the ramp up of new products, it's the impact of all the upgrades in the metro and actually some of the telecom products spreading to and going into non-telecom application with telecom-type products. So all those combined together should help grow the revenue but, on the long term, I expect that to be in the $100 million level.
I think, Simon, the answer to that is, I don't know, because a lot of equipment that goes in the edge of the submarine line is the regular equipment we sell to other telco applications. So we know there are some submarine lines looking at equipment from us, but we don't know how much of it is going to either one of the applications. Some of them are starting to look at the high data rate coherence and things like that, but there's still time to go for that to be meaningful. But the rest of it, I wouldn't know how to break it down.
Well, it -- I mean, I think majority of it is in the telco side but, again, I don't have the visibility to them.
Well, the backhaul equipment, which we talked -- the wireless, we talked about China, was slightly up this quarter, not much. And we predicted to be slightly up again, but not in any significance. So the level is flat to slightly up over the prior quarter and the quarter looking forward. And the margin impact of those is the same as it was before. It's below our corporate average.
I would say we're shipping samples to customers. Customers have received our sample have a very good respond, are very happy with our performance. There are some cases they're surprised with the performance. But it's early days and we're in the alpha stage. And as far as the program versus our schedule, I would say plus, minus couple of weeks we're on schedule. So we expect to continue with the program and continue with the ramp. It's a significant product program from us and again we're excited about the performance and level we can achieve from this module.
I don't think we are excluded from any deployment. Our ROADM business, we don't break it down but it's doing fine. It's not growing tremendously, but it's pretty flat quarter-over-quarter and we have significant share in the market. I don't think our share changes -- our share has changed in the market in any meaningful way. And we actually have high expectations for the market going forward from our ROADM play actually in the metro projects that you're talking about. So I don't think not all but lost any step in this market and I think our new products are playing very well. But I haven't -- we haven't seen growth yet and that's what we're looking for. But the product line itself is working fine.
Look, I mean, the only thing I can say -- we can't talk about specific customers because we can't comment on what one customer does versus others. All I can say, we have share in all of them. And when everybody wins -- when each one of them wins, I mean, we benefit from one versus the other. And maybe in some different weights or issues, but we do. But I can't comment on a specific customer versus others.
And we don't have any meaningful telecom below 10G, anyway.
No, we can't.","Well, Patrick, last quarter, we started shipping -- demonstrating basically alpha products. And we've continued ramping our shipment to customers, and we -- as we said before, we see that being more meaningful to our revenue towards the end of the calendar year. So we continue to ship units for 100 Gb application and 200 Gb application in the CFP2 format.
It's -- I think the growth we've seen to date is from existing product that we had shipped before and we start to see ramp from new products, from a lot of our dual product lines. So we expect that, that will be favorable for the WSS as we move along the year.
I think it stays the same. We don't change the date. I think the meaningful demand from this is beginning of next calendar year as the deployment, I don't think, have started in significant -- significantly right now. But we -- it is happening. From all the public announcements, you see its happening. And what was the other question?
But in general, I would say all the products that we have, the highest gross margin come from our newer products, and the big coherent is a product line. I mean, the CFP2 product is the first product of it. So in the future, we see more and more impact of those products coming into the mix of the gross margin and they affect us positively.
We think we have a very competitive product. We think from the best of our knowledge is we have the only product in the market that's already sampling -- that does 100 and 200 Gb on the same device as is today. So your limitation is on your DSP, not on the optics. And going forward, we are -- our plan is to get a significant market share. What that will be, time will tell, but we treat it extremely seriously. All the components are made inside, so we are fully vertically-integrated on the product. And as we come into GA, the full product is going to be manufactured in our Asian facility. So it's planned to be a significant ramp for us.
I think it's more important on the later generations than immediate. But when people are getting the product, they have both capabilities available for them Day 1 from us. Effectively, if you can run 200 Gb, your cost per bit is close to 50%, than what you run on 100 Gb because the cost of the hardware is the same. So I think from that point of view, it's important. But the timing when people are actually utilizing the 200 versus the 100 will depend on the customers themselves. But we believe getting into the market with a product that enables this Day 1 is a significant improvement or significant edge.
Well, Patrick, last quarter, we started shipping -- demonstrating basically alpha products. And we've continued ramping our shipment to customers, and we -- as we said before, we see that being more meaningful to our revenue towards the end of the calendar year. So we continue to ship units for 100 Gb application and 200 Gb application in the CFP2 format.
It's -- I think the growth we've seen to date is from existing product that we had shipped before and we start to see ramp from new products, from a lot of our dual product lines. So we expect that, that will be favorable for the WSS as we move along the year.
I think it stays the same. We don't change the date. I think the meaningful demand from this is beginning of next calendar year as the deployment, I don't think, have started in significant -- significantly right now. But we -- it is happening. From all the public announcements, you see its happening. And what was the other question?
But in general, I would say all the products that we have, the highest gross margin come from our newer products, and the big coherent is a product line. I mean, the CFP2 product is the first product of it. So in the future, we see more and more impact of those products coming into the mix of the gross margin and they affect us positively.
We think we have a very competitive product. We think from the best of our knowledge is we have the only product in the market that's already sampling -- that does 100 and 200 Gb on the same device as is today. So your limitation is on your DSP, not on the optics. And going forward, we are -- our plan is to get a significant market share. What that will be, time will tell, but we treat it extremely seriously. All the components are made inside, so we are fully vertically-integrated on the product. And as we come into GA, the full product is going to be manufactured in our Asian facility. So it's planned to be a significant ramp for us.
